The 200th anniversary of the birth of novelist Charles Dickens was celebrated on February 7, 2012, a Tuesday.  On what day of the week was Dickens born?', 'Solution': ' In this solution we refer to moving to the left as decreasing the year or date number and moving to the right as  increasing the year or date number. Every non-leap year we move to the right results in moving one day to the right because $365\\\\equiv 1\\\\pmod 7$ .  Every leap year we move to the right results in moving $2$ days to the right since $366\\\\equiv 2\\\\pmod 7$ . A leap year is usually every four years, so 200 years would have $\\\\frac{200}{4}$ = $50$ leap years, but the problem says that 1900 does not count as a leap year. Therefore there would be 151 regular years and 49 leap years, so $1(151)+2(49)$ = $249$ days back.  Since $249 \\\\equiv 4\\\\ (\\\\text{mod}\\\\ 7)$ , four days back from Tuesday would be $\\\\boxed{\\\\textbf{(A)}\\\\ \\\\text{Friday}}$ . Since they say that February $7$ th, $2012$ is the $200$ th anniversary of Charles dickens birthday, that means that the birth of Charles Dickens is on February $7$ th, $1812$ . We then see that there is a leap year on $1812, 1816, ...., 2008$ but we must excluse $1900$ which equates to $49$ leap years. So, the amount of days we have to go back is $200(365) + 49$ days which in $\\\\text{mod }7$ gives us 4. Thus, $4$ days back from Tuesday is $\\\\boxed{\\\\textbf{(A)}\\\\ \\\\text{Friday}}$ .'}\n",

What is $a$ ?', 'Solution': ' Every term in the expansion of the product is formed by taking one term from each factor and multiplying them all together. Therefore, we pick a power of $x$ or a power of $2$ from each factor. Every number, including $2012$ , has a unique representation by the sum of powers of two, and that representation can be found by converting a number to its binary form. $2012 = 11111011100_2$ , meaning $2012 = 1024 + 512 + 256 + 128 + 64 + 16 + 8 + 4$ . Thus, the $x^{2012}$ term was made by multiplying $x^{1024}$ from the $(x^{1024} + 1024)$ factor, $x^{512}$ from the $(x^{512} + 512)$ factor, and so on. The only numbers not used are $32$ , $2$ , and $1$ . Thus, from the $(x^{32} + 32), (x^2+2), (x+1)$ factors, $32$ , $2$ , and $1$ were chosen as opposed to $x^{32}, x^2$ , and $x$ . Thus, the coefficient of the $x^{2012}$ term is $32 \\\\times 2 \\\\times 1 = 64 = 2^6$ . So the answer is $6 \\\\rightarrow \\\\boxed{B}$ . The degree of $P(x)$ is $1024+512+256+\\\\cdots+1=2047$ . We want to find the coefficient of $x^{2012}$ , so we need to omit the powers of $2$ that add up to $2047-2012=35$ . We find that $35=2^0+2^1+2^5$ .

To get to $41$ , we have to add $41 - 26 = 15$ . If $a+b=15$ , at least one of $a$ and $b$ must be even because two odd numbers sum to an even number.

The first two integers sum up to $26$ . Since $26$ is even, in order to minimize the number of even integers, we make both of the first two odd. The second two integers sum up to $41-26=15$ . Since $15$ is odd, we must have at least one even integer in these next two. Finally, $57-41=16$ , and once again, $16$ is an even number so both of these integers can be odd.

What is the degree measure of the smallest possible sector angle?', 'Solution': ' Let $a_1$ be the first term of the arithmetic progression and $a_{12}$ be the last term of the arithmetic progression. From the formula of the sum of an arithmetic progression (or arithmetic series), we have $12*\\\\frac{a_1+a_{12}}{2}=360$ , which leads us to $a_1 + a_{12} = 60$ . $a_{12}$ , the largest term of the progression, can also be expressed as $a_1+11d$ , where $d$ is the common difference. Since each angle measure must be an integer, $d$ must also be an integer. We can isolate $d$ by subtracting $a_1$ from $a_{12}$ like so: $a_{12}-a_1=a_1+11d-a_1=11d$ . Since $d$ is an integer, the difference between the first and last terms, $11d$ , must be divisible by $11.$ Since the total difference must be less than $60$ , we can start checking multiples of $11$ less than $60$ for the total difference between $a_1$ and $a_{12}$ .

Since every value of $120-\\\\sqrt{x}$ gives one and only one possible value for $x$ , the number of values of $x$ is $\\\\boxed{\\\\textbf{(E) }11}$ .   2006 AMC 12A ( Problems • Answer Key • Resources )   Preceded\\xa0by Problem 9   Followed\\xa0by Problem 11    1  •  2  •  3  •  4  •  5  •  6  •  7  •  8  •  9  •  10  •  11  •  12  •  13  •  14  •  15  •  16  •  17  •  18  •  19  •  20  •  21  •  22  •  23  •  24  •  25    All AMC 12 Problems and Solutions    2006 AMC 10A ( Problems • Answer Key • Resources )   Preceded\\xa0by Problem 9   Followed\\xa0by Problem 11    1  •  2  •  3  •  4  •  5  •  6  •  7  •  8  •  9  •  10  •  11  •  12  •  13  •  14  •  15  •  16  •  17  •  18  •  19  •  20  •  21  •  22  •  23  •  24  •  25    All AMC 10 Problems and Solutions  The problems on this page are copyrighted by the Mathematical Association of America 's American Mathematics Competitions .

      "9: {'_id': 'b11f9657-d429-49d3-9f96-57d429c9d3b1', 'Contest': 'AMC12B', 'Year': 2012, 'Number': 12, 'Link': 'https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/2012_AMC_12B_Problems/Problem_12', 'Problem': ' How many sequences of zeros and ones of length 20 have all the zeros consecutive, or all the ones consecutive, or both?', 'Solution': \" Solution 1 There are $\\\\binom{20}{2}$ selections; however, we count these twice, therefore $2\\\\cdot\\\\binom{20}{2} = \\\\boxed{\\\\textbf{(D)}\\\\ 380}$ . The wording of the question implies D, not E. However, MAA decided to accept both D and E. Solution 2 Consider the 20 term sequence of $0$ 's and $1$ 's.  Keeping all other terms 1, a sequence of $k>0$ consecutive 0's can be placed in $21-k$ locations. That is, there are 20 strings with 1 zero, 19 strings with 2 consecutive zeros, 18 strings with 3 consecutive zeros, ..., 1 string with 20 consecutive zeros. Hence there are $20+19+\\\\cdots+1=\\\\binom{21}{2}$ strings with consecutive zeros. The same argument shows there are $\\\\binom{21}{2}$ strings with consecutive 1's. This yields $2\\\\binom{21}{2}$ strings in all. However, we have counted twice those strings in which all the 1's and all the 0's are consecutive. These are the cases $01111...$ , $00111...$ , $000111...$ , ..., $000...0001$ (of which there are 19) as well as the cases $10000...$ , $11000...$ , $111000...$ , ..., $111...110$ (of which there are 19 as well). This yields $2\\\\binom{21}{2}-2\\\\cdot19=\\\\boxed{\\\\textbf{(E)}\\\\ 382}$  First, we think of ways to make all the $1$ 's consecutive. If there are no consecutive $1$ 's, there are $\\\\binom{20}{0}$ ways to order them. If there is one consecutive $1$ , there are $\\\\binom{20}{1}$ ways to order them. If there are two consecutive $1$ 's, then there are $\\\\binom{19}{1}$ ways to order them (We treat the two $1$ 's like a block, and then order that block with 18 other $0$ 's). Continuing in this fashion, there are $\\\\binom{20}{0} + \\\\binom{20}{1} + \\\\binom{19}{1} + \\\\cdots + \\\\binom{1}{1} = 1 + 20 + 19 + \\\\cdots + 2 + 1 = 210 + 1 = 211$ ways to order consecutive $1$ 's. From symmetry, there are also $211$ ways to order the $0$ 's. Now, from PIE, we subtract out the cases where both the $1$ 's and the $0$ 's are consecutive. We do this because when counting the ways to order the $1$ 's, we counted all of these cases once. Then, we did so again when ordering the $0$ 's. So, to only have all of these cases once, we must subtract them. If $1$ is the leftmost digit, then there are $20$ cases where all the $1$ 's and $0$ 's are consecutive (we basically are choosing how many $1$ 's are consecutive, and there are $20$ possibilities. All other digits become $0$ , which are automatically consecutive since the $1$ 's are consecutive. There are also $20$ cases when $0$ is the left-most digit. Thus, there are a total of $211 + 211 - 20 - 20 = \\\\boxed{\\\\textbf{(E)}\\\\ 382}$ . But, from the way the problem is worded, it somewhat implies that the orderings must include both $1$ 's and $0$ 's, so the answer would then be $\\\\boxed{\\\\textbf{(D)}\\\\ 380}$ after we subtract out the cases where the orderings are either all $1$ 's or all $0$ 's. But, since this is unclear, MAA accepted both $\\\\boxed{\\\\textbf{(D}\\\\ 380}$ and $\\\\boxed{\\\\textbf{(E)}\\\\ 382}$ as acceptable answers.  Solution 4 We consider two cases, and subtract their overcount. Case $1$ : Consecutive $0$ s If we have one consecutive $0$ , then we have $20$ ways.\\nIf we have two consecutive $0$ s, then we have $19$ ways by thinking of the two consecutives as a block.\\nContinuing this pattern, if we have twenty consecutive $0$ s, then we have only $1$ way. Therefore, we have $20+19+\\\\cdots+1=\\\\binom{21}{2}$ ways for this case. Case $2$ : Consecutive $1$ s Notice that if we just swap every $0$ to a $1$ in the previous case, we also have a valid arrangement.\\nHence, we also have $20+19+\\\\cdots+1=\\\\binom{21}{2}$ ways for this case. Overcount: \\nNotice that we can have BOTH the $0$ s and the $1$ s be consecutive. These are the cases $01111...$ , $00111...$ , $000111...$ , ..., $000...0000$ which gives us $20$ ways being overcounted. If we invert the $0$ s to $1$ s, we similarly have $20$ more ways, hence we need to subtract $40$ from our total count. (Note: this method of overcounting subtracts out the all $0$ s and the all $1$ s case since the problem implies that there needs to be at least one of each) So we have $210 + 210 - 40 = 380$ ways which gives us $\\\\boxed{\\\\textbf{(D)}\\\\ 380}$ . ~xHypotenuse \"}\n"
