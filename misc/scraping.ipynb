It is convenient to drop the usual way how exponentiation is denoted, and to write the formula as $2\\uparrow 2\\uparrow 2\\uparrow 2$ , where $\\uparrow$ denotes exponentiation.

There are 5 ways to do so: $2\\uparrow (2\\uparrow (2\\uparrow 2))$  $2\\uparrow ((2\\uparrow 2)\\uparrow 2)$  $((2\\uparrow 2)\\uparrow 2)\\uparrow 2$  $(2\\uparrow (2\\uparrow 2))\\uparrow 2$  $(2\\uparrow 2)\\uparrow (2\\uparrow 2)$ We can note that $2\\uparrow (2\\uparrow 2) = (2\\uparrow 2)\\uparrow 2 =16$ .

      " Solution 1 Let $r_1$ and $r_2$ be the radii of circles $A$ and $B$ , respectively. It is well known that in a circle with radius $r$ , a subtended arc opposite an angle of $\\theta$ degrees has length $\\frac{\\theta}{360} \\cdot 2\\pi r$ . Using that here, the arc of circle A has length $\\frac{45}{360}\\cdot2\\pi{r_1}=\\frac{r_1\\pi}{4}$ . The arc of circle B has length $\\frac{30}{360} \\cdot 2\\pi{r_2}=\\frac{r_2\\pi}{6}$ . We know that they are equal, so $\\frac{r_1\\pi}{4}=\\frac{r_2\\pi}{6}$ , so we multiply through and simplify to get $\\frac{r_1}{r_2}=\\frac{2}{3}$ . As all circles are similar to one another, the ratio of the areas is just the square of the ratios of the radii, so our answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A) } 4/9}$ . Solution 2 The arc of circle $A$ is $\\frac{45}{30}=\\frac{3}{2}$ that of circle $B$ . The circumference of circle $A$ is $\\frac{2}{3}$ that of circle $B$ ( $B$ is the larger circle). The radius of circle $A$ is $\\frac{2}{3}$ that of circle $B$ . The area of circle $A$ is ${\\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)}^2=\\boxed{\\textbf{(A) } 4/9}$ that of circle $B$ . Solution 3 We can use a very cheap way to find the answer based on the choices. Firstly, if a higher angle measure equals a lower angle measure, that means that the ratio of areas must be lower, cutting D and E. Then we realize that the ratio has to be with square numbers, as there are no square roots. Therefore, it is $(A)$  -dragoon Solution 4 Written by a 6th grader, please don't mind* Set Circle A's arc to 45 degrees. In a full circle, there is 360 degrees, so 360/45 = 8. If we set the arc to be pi degrees, then in total there will be 8 pi in the circumference of this circle, yielding 4 as the radius and 16pi as the area. Since the arc of 30 degrees in Circle B is also pi, and there are 12 30 degree arcs in a circle, there will be 12pi in the circumference of Circle B, yielding 6 as the radius and 36pi as the area. Now, we put 16pi/36pi as our ratio, yielding 16/36=4/9. Therefore, it is $(A)$ 4/9. ~MathKatana\n",

      " A $0.8$ MB file can either be on its own disk, or share it with a $0.4$ MB. Clearly it is better to pick the second possibility. Thus we will have $3$ disks, each with one $0.8$ MB file and one $0.4$ MB file. We are left with $12$ files of $0.7$ MB each, and $12$ files of $0.4$ MB each. Their total size is $12\\cdot (0.7 + 0.4) = 13.2$ MB. The total capacity of $9$ disks is $9\\cdot 1.44 = 12.96$ MB, hence we need at least $10$ more disks. And we can easily verify that $10$ disks are indeed enough: six of them will carry two $0.7$ MB files each, and four will carry three $0.4$ MB files each. Thus our answer is $3+10 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }13 }$ . Similarly to Solution 1, we see that there must be $3$ disks to account for the $0.8$ MB file. Secondly, since there are $[30-(3+12)]-3 = 12$ files(for both 0.4 MB and 0.7 MB) left, it is easy to see that the optimal way to place the files would be $3$ files per disks for the 0.4 MB files and hence would require 4 disks. We are left with $12$ files( $0.7$ MB), where the optimal number of files per disks is $2$ , so the optimal number of disks for this type of file would be $6$ disks.

Setting the two equal, we have $40t+2=60t-3$ and we find $t=\\frac{1}{4}$ of an hour. Substituting t back in, we find $d=12$ . From $d=rt$ , we find that $r$ , our answer, is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }48 }$ .

Tina gets a sum of 3: This happens in only one way $(1,2)$ and Sergio can choose a number from 4 to 10, inclusive. There are 7 ways that Sergio gets a desirable number here. Tina gets a sum of 4: This once again happens in only one way $(1,3)$ . Sergio can choose a number from 5 to 10, so 6 ways here. Tina gets a sum of 5: This can happen in two ways $(1,4)$ and $(2,3)$ . Sergio can choose a number from 6 to 10, so $2\\cdot5=10$ ways here. Tina gets a sum of 6: Two ways here $(1,5)$ and $(2,4)$ . Sergio can choose a number from 7 to 10, so $2\\cdot4=8$ here. Tina gets a sum of 7: Two ways here $(2,5)$ and $(3,4)$ . Sergio can choose from 8 to 10, so $2\\cdot3=6$ ways here. Tina gets a sum of 8: Only one way possible $(3,5$ ). Sergio chooses 9 or 10, so 2 ways here. Tina gets a sum of 9: Only one way $(4,5)$ . Sergio must choose 10, so 1 way. In all, there are $7+6+10+8+6+2+1=40$ ways. Tina chooses two distinct numbers in $\\binom{5}{2}=10$ ways while Sergio chooses a number in $10$ ways, so there are $10\\cdot 10=100$ ways in all. Since $\\frac{40}{100}=\\frac{2}{5}$ , our answer is $\\boxed{\\text{(A)}\\frac{2}{5}}$ . Solution 2 We invoke some symmetry. Let $T$ denote Tina's sum, and let $S$ denote Sergio's number. Observe that, for $i = 2, 3, \\ldots, 10$ , $\\text{Pr}(T=i) = \\text{Pr}(T=12-i)$ . If Tina's sum is $i$ , then the probability that Sergio's number is larger than Tina's sum is $\\frac{10-i}{10}$ . Thus, the probability $P$ is \\[P = \\text{Pr}(S>T) = \\sum_{i=2}^{10} \\text{Pr}(T=i) \\times \\frac{10-i}{10}\\]  Using the symmetry observation, we can also write the above sum as \\[P = \\sum_{i=2}^{10} \\text{Pr}(T=12-i) \\times \\frac{10-i}{10} = \\sum_{i=2}^{10} \\text{Pr}(T=i) \\times \\frac{i-2}{10}\\] where the last equality follows as we reversed the indices of the sum (by replacing $12-i$ with $i$ ). Thus, adding the two equivalent expressions for $P$ , we have \\begin{align*} 2P &= \\sum_{i=2}^{10} \\text{Pr}(T=i) \\times \\left(\\frac{10-i}{10} + \\frac{i-2}{10}\\right) \\\\ &= \\sum_{i=2}^{10} \\text{Pr}(T=i) \\times \\frac{4}{5} \\\\ &= \\frac{4}{5} \\sum_{i=2}^{10} \\text{Pr}(T=i) \\\\ &= \\frac{4}{5} \\end{align*}  Since this represents twice the desired probability, the answer is $P = \\boxed{\\textbf{(A)} \\frac{2}{5}}$ . -scrabbler94 We have 5 cases, if Tina choose $1, 2, 3, 4,$ or $5.$  The number of ways of choosing 2 numbers from $5$ are $\\binom{5}{2}$ . Case 1: Tina chooses $1$ . In this case, since the numbers are distinct, Tina can choose $(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4),$ or $(1, 5).$  If Tina chooses $1$ and $2$ which sum to $3$ , Sergio only has $10-3=7$ choices. Since the sum of the combined numbers increases by $1$ every time for this specific case, Sergio has $1$ less choice every time. Therefore, the probability of this is $\\frac{7+6+5+4}{10 \\cdot \\binom{5}{2}}$ . If you do this over and over again you will see that you have $\\frac{(7+6+5+4)+(7+5+4+3)+(6+5+3+2)+(5+4+3+1)+(4+3+2+1)}{10 \\cdot \\binom{5}{2}} = \\frac{80}{100} = \\frac{4}{5}$ probability. But since we overcounted by 2 (e.g. $(1, 2)$ and $(2, 1)$ ) we need to divide by $2.$  Thus our answer is $\\frac{4}{5} \\div 2 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(A)} \\frac{2}{5}}.$  ~mathboy282 Note: I will add in all the cases soon, kind of busy today so yea. Solution 4 Assume Sergio chooses from ${2,3,\\ldots,10}$ . The probability of Tina getting a sum of $6+x$ and a sum of $6-x$ , where $x \\leq 4$ , are equal due to symmetry. The probability of Sergio choosing numbers higher/lower than $6+x$ is equal to him choosing numbers lower/higher than $6-x$ .

The probability of it doing so is the ratio of areas of $ABD'$ to $ABC$ , or equivalently, the ratio of $AD'$ to $AC$ because the triangles have identical altitudes when taking $AD'$ and $AC$ as bases.

If you draw a line segment from each vertex to the center of the octagon and draw the rectangle ABEF (in red), you can see that $2$ of the triangles (in blue) share the same base and height with $\\dfrac{1}{2}$ the rectangle. Therefore, the rectangle's area is the same as $2\\cdot2$ of the $8$ triangles, and is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D)}\\ \\frac{1}{2}}$ the area of the octagon.

The triangles each are $45-45-90$ triangles, and since their diagonal is length $x$ , each of their sides is $\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}x$ . The area of the entire figure is, likewise, $x^2$ (the square) $+4x^2\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$ (the 4 rectangles) $+2\\cdot(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}x)^2$ (the triangles), which simplifies to $2x^2 + 2\\sqrt{2}x^2$ .

By realizing that, the area of the trapezoid is $(\\frac{2+\\sqrt{2}}{2})(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$ ). To make this product easier, note there is two trapezoids, so the new product is now this, $(\\frac{2+\\sqrt{2}}{2})(\\sqrt{2}) = \\sqrt{2} + 1$  Notice how the rectangle has side lengths $\\sqrt{2}+1$ and $1$ , so it's area is also $\\sqrt{2}+1$ . The ratio of the area of rectangle $ABEF$ to the two trapezoids is $1:1$ , meaning they share half the area of the octagon.

      " Substitute $a^cb^d$ into $x$ . We then have $7(a^{5c}b^{5d}) = 11y^{13}$ . Divide both sides by $7$ , and it follows that: \\[(a^{5c}b^{5d}) = \\frac{11y^{13}}{7}.\\]  Note that because $11$ and $7$ are prime, the minimum value of $x$ must involve factors of $7$ and $11$ only. Thus, we try to look for the lowest power $p$ of $11$ such that $13p + 1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$ , so that we can take $11^{13p + 1}$ to the fifth root. Similarly, we want to look for the lowest power $n$ of $7$ such that $13n - 1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$ . Again, this allows us to take the fifth root of $7^{13n - 1}$ . Obviously, we want to add $1$ to $13p$ and subtract $1$ from $13n$ because $11^{13p}$ and $7^{13n}$ are multiplied by $11$ and divided by $7$ , respectively. With these conditions satisfied, we can simply multiply $11^{p}$ and $7^{n}$ and substitute this quantity into $y$ to attain our answer. We can simply look for suitable values for $p$ and $n$ . We find that the lowest $p$ , in this case, would be $3$ because $13(3) + 1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$ . Moreover, the lowest $q$ should be $2$ because $13(2) - 1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$ . Hence, we can substitute the quantity $11^{3} \\cdot 7^{2}$ into $y$ . Doing so gets us: \\[(a^{5c}b^{5d}) = \\frac{11(11^{3} \\cdot 7^{2})^{13}}{7} = 11^{40} \\cdot 7^{25}.\\]  Taking the fifth root of both sides, we are left with $a^cb^d = 11^{8} \\cdot 7^{5}$ . $a + b + c + d = 11 + 7 + 8 + 5 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(B)}\\ 31}$  A simpler way to tackle this problem without all that modding is to keep the equation as: \\[7*a^{5b}c^{5d} = 11y^{13}\\]  As stated above, $a$ and $c$ must be the factors 7 and 11 in order to keep $x$ at a minimum. Moving all the non-y terms to the left hand side of the equation, we end up with: \\[7^{5b+1}11^{5d-1}=y^{13}\\]  The above equation means that $y$ must also contain only the factors 7 and 11 (again, in order to keep $x$ at a minimum), so we end up with: \\[7^{5b+1}11^{5d-1}=7^{13h}11^{13j}\\]  ( $h$ and $j$ are arbitrary variables placed in order to show that $y$ could have more than just one 7 or one 11 as factors) Since 7 and 11 are prime, we know that $5b+1=13h$ and $5d-1=13j$ . The smallest positive combinations that would work are $b=5,h=2$ and $d=8,j=3$ . Therefore, $a+b+c+d=7+5+11+8=31$ . $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B)}\\ 31}$ is correct. Another way to solve this problem solve for x. First, we can divide both sides by 7 to get: \\[x^5 = \\frac{11y^{13}}{7}\\]  Next, we take the fifth root on both sides, which gets us: \\[x = \\sqrt[5]{\\frac{11y^{13}}{7}}\\]  \\[x = y^2 \\cdot \\sqrt[5]{\\frac{11y^{3}}{7}}\\]  Since we know x is a positive integer that we are trying to minimize, we can let y equal the smallest number that will make x an integer. In this case, we let $y = 11^3 \\cdot 7^2$ (Make sure you see why this makes x the smallest integer possible!), which when plugged in, results in: \\[x = (11^3 \\cdot 7^2)^2 \\cdot \\sqrt[5]{\\frac{11}{7}\\cdot (11^3 \\cdot 7^2)^3}\\]  \\[x = (11^3 \\cdot 7^2)^2 \\cdot \\sqrt[5]{\\frac{11}{7}\\cdot 11^9 \\cdot 7^6}\\]  \\[x = (11^3 \\cdot 7^2)^2 \\cdot \\sqrt[5]{11^{10} \\cdot 7^5}\\]  \\[x = (11^3 \\cdot 7^2)^2 \\cdot 11^2 \\cdot 7^1\\]  \\[x = 7^5 \\cdot 11^ 8\\]  This gets us $a^cb^d = 7^5\\cdot 11^8$ , so $a + b + c + d = 7 + 5 + 11 + 8 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(B)}\\ 31}$ ~lucaswujc, $\\LaTeX$ help from Technodoggo According to the problem, we have that $x^5$ and $y^{13}$ must be a multiple of both $7$ and $11$ .

The property obviously holds true if $5$ or $6$ of the faces are colored the same, which for each color can happen in $6 + 1 = 7$ ways. If $4$ of the faces are colored the same, there are $3$ possible cubes (corresponding to the $3$ possible ways to pick pairs of opposite faces for the other color). If $3$ of the faces are colored the same, the property obviously cannot be satisfied.

As with the previous solution, we will simply count the number of valid faces and divide by $2^6$ . We say that a cube has a ring of color when four vertical faces are all the same color. If we fix the cube in space, there can be $3$ different rings (in each of the $3$ axis), each of which can take on 2 different colors. This leaves us to choose the remaining two faces (which are opposite one another) in $2^2=4$ ways. However, we have counted coloring that has each face the same color $3$ times for both red and blue. This means that we must subtract the 4 overcounts to get $2*3*2^2-4=20$ . Dividing by $2^6$ total colorings, we get $20/2^6=\\frac{5}{16}\\mathbf{(B)}$ .\n",

      " The only way to get a total of $ $20$ or more is if you pick a twenty and another bill, or if you pick both tens. There are a total of $\\dbinom{8}{2}=\\dfrac{8\\times7}{2\\times1}=28$ ways to choose $2$ bills out of $8$ . There are $12$ ways to choose a twenty and some other non-twenty bill. There is $1$ way to choose both twenties, and also $1$ way to choose both tens. Adding these up, we find that there are a total of $14$ ways to attain a sum of $20$ or greater, so there is a total probability of $\\dfrac{14}{28}=\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) }\\frac{1}{2}}$ . Another way to do this problem is to use complementary counting , i.e. how many ways that the sum is less than $20$ . Now, you do not have to consider the $2$ twenties, so you have $6$ bills left. $\\dbinom{6}{2} = \\dfrac{6\\times5}{2\\times1} = 15$ ways. However, you counted the case when you have $2$ tens, so you need to subtract 1, and you get $14$ . Finding the ways to get $20$ or higher, you subtract $14$ from $28$ and get $14$ . So the answer is $\\dfrac{14}{28} = \\boxed{\\textbf{(D) }\\dfrac{1}{2}}$  There are two cases that work, namely getting at least $1$ twenty, or getting $2$ tens. Case $1$ : $P(\\text{Get at least one twenty}) = 1-P(\\text{Do not get a single twenty})=1- \\frac{\\binom{6}{2}}{\\binom{8}{2}}=\\frac{28-15}{28}=\\frac{13}{28}$  Case $2$ : $P(\\text{Get two tens}) = \\frac{1}{\\binom{8}{2}} = \\frac{1}{28}$  Summing up our cases, we have $\\frac{13}{28}+\\frac{1}{28}=\\frac{14}{28}=\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) } \\dfrac{1}{2}}$  Note that if a twenty is drawn, anything else that is drawn will create a total greater than $20$ ; The probability of a twenty being drawn first is $\\frac{1}{4}.$ The same could be said for drawing anything, and then drawing a twenty. However, we can only draw something that isn't a twenty first (since we've already accounted for the probability of drawing two twenties). The probability of drawing a non-twenty first, then a twenty second is $\\frac{3}{4}\\cdot\\frac{2}{7}=\\frac{3}{14}.$ Finally, we can draw two tens. The probability of this occuring is $\\frac{1}{4}\\cdot\\frac{1}{7}=\\frac{1}{28}.$  Adding these three probabilities gives us $\\frac{1}{4}+\\frac{3}{14}+\\frac{1}{28}=\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) } \\dfrac{1}{2}}$  -Benedict T (countmath1) (edited by AMC_8) We see that there are $2$ of each bill. We can simplify the question to only drawing $1$ bill out of $4$ , and trying to draw $$ 10$ . (Originally you need to draw $$ 20$ , but the bill is halved, so you need to draw only $$ 10$ .) We see that we have $1$ of each bill $$1$ , $$5$ , $$10$ , and $$20$ .\n",

Base Case: trivial Inductive Step: Suppose the formula is correct for $z_k$ , then \\[z_{k+1}=\\frac{iz_k}{\\overline {z_k}}=i e^{i\\theta_k} e^{i\\theta_k}=e^{i(2\\theta_k+\\pi/2)}\\] Since \\[2\\theta_k+\\frac{\\pi}{2}=2\\cdot 2^n(\\theta_0+\\frac{\\pi}{2})-\\pi+\\frac{\\pi}{2}=2^{n+1}(\\theta_0+\\frac{\\pi}{2})-\\frac{\\pi}{2}=\\theta_{n+1}\\] the formula is proven $z_{2005}=1\\Rightarrow \\theta_{2005}=2k\\pi$ , where $k$ is an integer. Therefore, \\[2^{2005}(\\theta_0+\\frac{\\pi}{2})=(2k+\\frac{1}{2})\\pi\\]  \\[\\theta_0=\\frac{k}{2^{2004}}\\pi+\\left(\\frac{1}{2^{2006}}-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\pi\\] The value of $\\theta_0$ only matters modulo  $2\\pi$ . Since $\\frac{k+2^{2005}}{2^{2004}}\\pi\\equiv\\frac{k}{2^{2004}}\\pi\\mod 2\\pi$ , k can take values from 0 to $2^{2005}-1$ , so the answer is $2^{2005}\\Rightarrow\\boxed{\\mathrm{E}}$  Let $z_0 = \\cos \\theta + i\\sin \\theta$ . \\[z_1 = \\frac {iz_{0}}{\\overline {z_{0}}} = \\frac{i(\\cos \\theta + i\\sin \\theta)}{\\cos \\theta - i\\sin \\theta} = i(\\cos \\theta + i\\sin \\theta)^2 = i(\\cos 2\\theta + i\\sin 2\\theta) = ie^{i2\\theta}\\]  \\[z_2 = \\frac {iz_{1}}{\\overline {z_{1}}} = \\frac{i(\\cos 2\\theta + i\\sin 2\\theta)}{\\cos 2\\theta - i\\sin 2\\theta} = i(\\cos 2\\theta + i\\sin 2\\theta)^{2} = i(\\cos 2^2\\theta + i\\sin 2^2\\theta) = ie^{i2^2\\theta}\\] Repeating through this recursive process, we can quickly see that \\[z_{2005} = ie^{i2^{2005}\\theta} = i(\\cos 2^{2005}\\theta + i\\sin 2^{2005}\\theta) = 1\\] Thus, $\\sin 2^{2005}\\theta = -1$ .

(Author: Patrick Yin) Quick note: the solution forgot the $i$ in front of $z_1$ when deriving $z_2$ , so the solution is inaccurate. Note that for any complex number $z$ , we have $|z|=|\\overline z|$ . Therefore, the magnitude of $\\frac{iz_n}{|z_n|}$ is always $1$ , meaning that all of the numbers in the sequence $z_k$ are of magnitude $1$ . Another property of complex numbers is that $z\\overline z=|z|^2$ . For the numbers in our sequence, this means $z\\overline z=1$ , so $\\overline z=z^{-1}$ . Rewriting our recursive condition with these facts, we now have \\[z_{n+1}=\\frac{iz_n}{z_n^{-1}}=iz_n^2.\\] Solving for $z_n$ here, we obtain \\[z_n=\\frac{\\pm\\sqrt{z_{n+1}}}i=-i\\cdot(\\pm\\sqrt{z_{n+1}}).\\] It is seen that there are two values of $z_n$ which correspond to one value of $z_{n+1}$ . That means that there are two possible values of $z_{2004}$ , four possible values of $z_{2003}$ , and so on. Therefore, there are $2^{2005}$ possible values of $z_0$ , giving the answer as $\\boxed{\\mathrm{(E)}\\text{ }2^{2005}}$ .  https://youtu.be/hKGwHUN8gQg?si=pCj35pPwVa-aaC3w  ~MathProblemSolvingSkills.com \n",

      "Therefore, $x^3 + y^3 = s\\cdot\\dfrac{3t-s^2}{2} = s(15s-\\dfrac{s^2}{2})$ .  \n",
      "Since $s = 10^z$ , we find that $x^3 + y^3 = 15\\cdot10^{2z} - (1/2)\\cdot10^{3z}$ .  \n",
      "Thus, $a+b = \\frac{29}{2}$  $\\Rightarrow$  $\\boxed{B}$  First, remember that $x^3 + y^3$ factors to $(x + y) (x^2 - xy + y^2)$ . By the givens, $x + y = 10^z$ and $x^2 + y^2 = 10^{z + 1}$ . These can be used to find $xy$ : \\[(x + y)^2 = 10^{2z}\\]  \\[x^2 + 2xy + y^2 = 10^{2z}\\]  \\[2xy = 10^{2z} - 10^{z + 1}\\]  \\[xy = \\frac{10^{2z} - 10^{z + 1}}{2}\\]  Therefore, \\[x^3 + y^3 = a \\cdot 10^{3z} + b \\cdot 10^{2z} = 10^z\\left(10^{z + 1} - \\frac{10^{2z} - 10^{z + 1}}{2}\\right)\\]  \\[= 10^z\\left(10^{z + 1} - \\frac{10^{2z} - 10^{z + 1}}{2}\\right)\\]  \\[= 10^{2z + 1} - \\frac{10^{3z} - 10^{2z + 1}}{2}\\]  \\[= -\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 10^{3z} + \\frac{3}{2} \\cdot 10^{2z + 1}\\]  \\[= -\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 10^{3z} + 15 \\cdot 10^{2z}.\\]  It follows that $a = -\\frac{1}{2}$ and $b = 15$ , thus $a + b = \\frac{29}{2}.$  We can rearrange $\\log_{10}(x+y)=z$ into $x+y=10^{z}$ and $\\log_{10}(x^2+y^2)=z+1$ into $x^2+y^2=10^{z+1}$  We can then put $x+y$ to the third power or $(x+y)^{3}=10^{3z}$ . Basic polynomial multiplication shows us that $(x+y)^{3}=x^3+3x^{2}y+3xy^{2}+y^3=10^{3z}$ Thus, $x^3+y^3=10^{3z}-3x^{2}y-3xy^{2}$ or $x^3+y^3=10^{3z}-3xy(x+y)$ . We know that $x+y=10^{z}$ so we have $x^3+y^3=10^{3z}-3xy(10^{z})$ . Now we need to find out what $xy$ is equal to in terms of $z$ . We will find $xy$ by squaring $x+y$ . It is basic polynomial multiplication to figure out that $(x+y)^{2}=x^2+2xy+y^2$ . We are also given that $x^2+y^2=10^{z+1}$ and $x+y=10^{z}$ . Thus $(10^{z})^{2}=10^{z+1}+2xy$ or $10^{2z}=10^{z+1}+2xy$ . Rearranging the terms of this equation we obtain that $xy=\\frac{10^{2z}-10^{z+1}}{2}$ or $xy=\\frac{10^z(10^z-10)}{2}$ . Now plugging this equation into our original equation $x^3+y^3=10^{3z}-3xy(10^{z})$ , we obtain the equation $x^3+y^3=10^{3z}-3(\\frac{10^z(10^z-10)}{2})(10^{z})$ Simple rearranging of this equation yields the result that $x^3+y^3=10^{3z}-3(\\frac{10^{3z}}{2})+30(\\frac{10^{2z}}{2})$ .\n",
      "Combining like terms we obtain the equation $x^3+y^3= -(\\frac{10^{3z}}{2})+30(\\frac{10^{2z}}{2})$ . Now we know the coefficients of $10^{3z}$ and $10^{2z}$ which are $\\frac{-1}{2}$ and $\\frac{30}{2}$ respectively. Adding the two coefficients we obtain an answer of $\\frac{29}{2}.$  $\\Rightarrow$  $\\boxed{B}$ (Author: David Camacho) From the given conditions it follows that \\[ x+y=10^z, \\quad x^2+y^2=10\\cdot 10^z\\quad\\text{and}\\quad 10^{2z}=(x+y)^2=x^2+2xy+y^2. \\] Thus \\[ xy=\\frac{1}{2}(10^{2z}-10\\cdot 10^z). \\] Also \\[ (x+y)^3=10^{3z}\\quad\\text{and}\\quad x^3+y^3=(x+y)^3-3xy(x+y), \\] which yields \\begin{align*} x^3+y^3&=10^{3z}-\\frac{3}{2}(10^{2z}-10\\cdot 10^z)(10^z) \\\\ &=10^{3z}-\\frac{3}{2}(10^{3z}-10\\cdot 10^{2z}) =-\\frac{1}{2}10^{3z}+15\\cdot 10^{2z}, \\end{align*} and $a+b=-\\frac{1}{2}+15=\\boxed{29/2}$ . No other value of $a + b$ is possible for all members of $S$ , because the triple $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}(1 + \\sqrt{19}), \\frac{1}{2}(1 - \\sqrt{19}), 0\\right)$ is in $S$ , and for this ordered triple, the equation $x^3 + y^3 = a\\cdot 10^{3z} + b\\cdot 10^{2z}$ reduces to $a + b = 29/2$ .\n",

      " Notice that if the consecutive positive integers have a sum of $15$ , then their average (which could be a fraction) must be a divisor of $15$ . If the number of integers in the list is odd, then the average must be either $1, 3,$ or $5$ , and $1$ is clearly not possible. The other two possibilities both work: $1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15$  $4 + 5 + 6 = 15$ If the number of integers in the list is even, then the average will have a $\\frac{1}{2}$ . The only possibility is $\\frac{15}{2}$ , from which we get: $15 = 7 + 8$ Thus, the correct answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }3}.$  Question: (RealityWrites) Is it possible that the answer is $4$ , because $0+1+2+3+4+5$ should technically count, right? Answer: (IMGROOT2) It isn't possible because the question asks for positive integers, and this means that negative integers or zero aren't allowed. Note to readers: make sure to always read the problem VERY carefully before attempting; it could mean the difference of making the cutoff. Any set will form a arithmetic progression with the first term say $a$ . Since the numbers are consecutive the common difference $d = 1$ . The sum of the AP has to be 15. So, \\[S_n = \\frac{n}{2} \\cdot (2a + (n-1)d)\\]  \\[S_n = \\frac{n}{2} \\cdot (2a + (n-1)1)\\]  \\[15 = \\frac{n}{2} \\cdot (2a + n - 1)\\]  \\[2an + n^2 - n = 30\\]  \\[n^2 + n(2a - 1) - 30 = 0\\]  Now we need to find the number of possible sets of values of a, n which satisfy this equation. Now $a$ cannot be 15 as we need 2 terms. So a can only be less the 15. Trying all the values of a from 1 to 14 we observe that $a = 4$ , $a = 7$ and $a = 1$ provide the only real solutions to the above equation.The three possibilites of a and n are. \\[(a,n) = (4,3),(7, 2),(1, 6)\\]  The above values are obtained by solving the following equations obtained by substituting the above mentioned values of a into $n^2 + n(2a - 1) - 30 = 0$ , \\[n^2 + 7n - 30 = 0\\]  \\[n^2 + 13n - 30 = 0\\]  \\[n^2 - n - 30 = 0\\]  Since there are 3 possibilities the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }3}.$    2006 AMC 12A ( Problems • Answer Key • Resources )   Preceded by Problem 7   Followed by Problem 9    1  •  2  •  3  •  4  •  5  •  6  •  7  •  8  •  9  •  10  •  11  •  12  •  13  •  14  •  15  •  16  •  17  •  18  •  19  •  20  •  21  •  22  •  23  •  24  •  25    All AMC 12 Problems and Solutions    2006 AMC 10A ( Problems • Answer Key • Resources )   Preceded by Problem 8   Followed by Problem 10    1  •  2  •  3  •  4  •  5  •  6  •  7  •  8  •  9  •  10  •  11  •  12  •  13  •  14  •  15  •  16  •  17  •  18  •  19  •  20  •  21  •  22  •  23  •  24  •  25    All AMC 10 Problems and Solutions  The problems on this page are copyrighted by the Mathematical Association of America 's American Mathematics Competitions .

      " Call this cube $ABCDEFGH$ , with $A$ being the starting point. Because in $7$ moves the bug has to visit the other vertices, the bug cannot revisit any vertex. Therefore, starting at $A$ , the bug has a $\\frac{3}{3}$ chance of finding a good path to the next vertex, and call it $B$ . Then, the bug has a $\\frac{2}{3}$ chance of reaching a new vertex next. Call this $C$ . $A, B,$ and $C$ are always on the same plane. Now, we split cases. Case $1$ : The bug goes to the vertex $E$ opposite $A$ on the space diagonal with probability $\\frac{1}{3}$ . Then, the bug has to visit $D$ on the plane of $ABC$ last, as there is no way in and out from $D$ . Therefore, there is only $1$ way out of $81$ to get to $D$ last. Therefore, there is a $\\frac{1}{243} \\cdot \\frac{6}{9} = \\frac{6}{2187}$ chance of finding a good path in this case. Case $2$ : The bug goes to vertex $D$ on plane $ABC$ with a chance of $\\frac{1}{3}$ . The bug then has only $1$ way to go to a point $E$ on the opposite face, therefore having a $\\frac{1}{3}$ probability. Then, the bug has a choice of two vertices on the face opposite to $ABCD$ . This results in a $\\frac{2}{3}$ probability of finding a good path to a point $F$ . Then, there is only $1$ way out of $9$ to visit both other vertices on that face in $2$ moves. Multiply the probabilities for this case to get $\\frac{2}{243} \\cdot \\frac{6}{9} = \\frac{12}{2187}$ . Add the probabilities of these two cases together to get $\\frac{18}{2187} = \\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }\\frac{2}{243}}.$  [asy] import three; unitsize(1cm); size(50); currentprojection=orthographic(1/2,-1,1/2); /* three - currentprojection, orthographic */ draw((0,0,0)--(1,0,0)--(1,1,0)--(0,1,0)--cycle); draw((0,0,0)--(0,0,1)); draw((0,1,0)--(0,1,1)); draw((1,1,0)--(1,1,1)); draw((1,0,0)--(1,0,1)); draw((0,0,1)--(1,0,1)--(1,1,1)--(0,1,1)--cycle); [/asy]  Let us count the good paths. The bug starts at an arbitrary vertex , moves to a neighboring vertex ( $3$ ways), and then to a new neighbor ( $2$ more ways).  So, without loss of generality, let the cube have vertices $ABCDEFGH$ such that $ABCD$ and $EFGH$ are two opposite faces with $A$ above $E$ and $B$ above $F$ .  The bug starts at $A$ and moves first to $B$ , then to $C$ . From this point, there are two cases. Case $1$ : the bug moves to $D$ .  From $D$ , there is only one good move available, to $H$ .  From $H$ , there are two ways to finish the trip, either by going $H \\to G \\to F \\to E$ or $H \\to E \\to F \\to G$ .  So there are $2$ good paths in this case. Case $2$ : the bug moves to $G$ . Case $2a$ : the bug moves $G \\to H$ .  In this case, there are $0$ good paths because it will not be possible to visit both $D$ and $E$ without double-visiting some vertex. Case $2b$ : the bug moves $G \\to F$ .  There is $1$ good path in this case, $F \\to E \\to H \\to D$ . 2006 AMC 12A Problems/Problem 20 (section) this solution is extremely good and very hard to learn if you learn this solution you are officially a math god, for a total of $3\\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 = 18$ good paths.  There were $3^7 = 2187$ possible paths the bug could have taken, so the probability of a random path is good is $\\frac{18}{2187} = \\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }\\frac2{243}}$ . As in Solution 1, the bug can move from its arbitrary starting vertex to a neighboring vertex in $3$ ways. After this, the bug can move to a new neighbor in $2$ ways (it cannot return to the first vertex). The total number of paths (as stated above) is $3^7$ or $2187$ . Therefore, the probability of the bug following a good path is equal to $\\frac{6x}{2187}$ for some positive integer $x$ .

      " Circles centered at $A$ and $B$ will overlap if $A$ and $B$ are closer to each other than if the circles were tangent. The circles are tangent when the distance between their centers is equal to the sum of their radii. Thus, the distance from $A$ to $B$ will be $2$ . Since $A$ and $B$ are separated by $1$ vertically, they must be separated by $\\sqrt{3}$ horizontally. Thus, if $|A_x-B_x|<\\sqrt{3}$ , the circles intersect. Now, plot the two random variables $A_x$ and $B_x$ on the coordinate plane. Each variable ranges from $0$ to $2$ . The circles intersect if the variables are within $\\sqrt{3}$ of each other. Thus, the area in which the circles don't intersect is equal to the total area of two small triangles on opposite corners, each of area $\\frac{(2-\\sqrt{3})^2}{2}$ . So, the total area of the 2 triangles sums to $(2-\\sqrt{3})^2$ . Since the total $2$ x $2$ square has an area of $4$ , the probability of the circles not intersecting is $\\frac{(2-\\sqrt{3})^2}{4}$ . But remember, we want the probability that they do intersect. We conclude the probability the circles intersect is: \\[1-\\frac{(2-\\sqrt{3})^2}{4}=\\boxed{\\textbf{(E)}\\frac{4\\sqrt{3}-3}{4}}.\\]  Two circles intersect if the distance between their centers is less than the sum of their radii. In this problem, $A$ and $B$ intersect iff $\\sqrt{(A_X-B_X)^2+(A_Y-B_Y)^2}\\leq2 \\Rightarrow (A_X-B_X)^2+1\\leq4 \\Rightarrow (A_X-B_X)\\leq \\sqrt{3}.$  In other words, the two chosen $x$ -coordinates must differ by no more than $\\sqrt{3}$ . To find this probability, we divide the problem into cases: 1) $A_X$ is on the interval $(0,2-\\sqrt{3})$ . The probability that $B_X$ falls within the desired range for a given $A_X$ is $A_X$ (on the left) $+\\sqrt{3}$ (on the right) all over $2$ (the range of possible values). The total probability for this range is the sum of all these probabilities of $B_X$ (over the range of $A_X$ ) divided by the total range of $A_X$ (which is $2$ ). Thus, the total probability for this interval is \\[\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\int_{0}^{2-\\sqrt{3}} \\frac{x+\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\,dx\\right) =\\frac{1}{2}\\left(x^2/4+\\frac{x\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\Big |_{0}^{2-\\sqrt{3}}\\right)\\]  \\[= \\frac{1}{2}(\\frac{4-4\\sqrt{3}+3}{4} + \\sqrt{3}-\\frac{3}{2}) =\\frac{1}{8}.\\] 2) $A_X$ is on the interval $(2-\\sqrt{3},\\sqrt{3})$ . In this case, any value of $B_X$ will do, so the probability for the interval is simply $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}-(2-\\sqrt{3})}{2} = \\sqrt{3}-1$ . 3) $A_X$ is on the interval $(\\sqrt{3},2)$ . This is identical, by symmetry, to case 1. The total probability is therefore $\\sqrt{3}-1+\\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{4\\sqrt{3}-3}{4} \\Rightarrow \\boxed{E}$  We first calculate the probability that the circles at are their maximum possible distance while still intersecting. Since the difference in heights is 1, and the two radii add up to 2 (at their point of tangency), we can see that the maximum possible distance for the two centers is $\\sqrt3$ . If we look at possible placements for the lower point, we see that at placement $(0,0)$ there is exactly $\\sqrt3$ of space wherein we can put the top point. Similarly, at point $(1,0)$ we can put the top point anywhere, resulting in $2$ of space. If one looks at a diagram (which I can't put here), we can see that the space available for the top point increases linearly from $(0,0)$ to $(2-\\sqrt3,0)$ . From then on to $(1,0)$ it stops at $2$ (this is symmetric for the other half of placements). If one draws a plot of the space available (which I again can't show here) with x determined by the x-value of the bottom point and y determined by space available for the top point, we notice two things: first, since for each (theoretically infinitesimally) small x-slice there is a line segment determining how much space there is available, if we sum up all of the line segments and divide by the total space (technically speaking by enumerating all the valid combinations and dividing by all of the general combinations), we will end up with a plot that looks like a rectangle with two small triangles cut out of it. Two, that since this is symmetric, we can just focus on the first half as the ratio of valid to total is the same. We see that the rectangle has a height of $2$ and a width of $1$ , thus its area is 2. The triangle's height is $2-\\sqrt3$ , and its width is the same thus its area is $(2-\\sqrt3)^2/2$ => $(7-4\\sqrt3)/2$ . Now we simply subtract to obtain $(4\\sqrt3-3)/2$ is the valid area, thus $(4\\sqrt3-3)/4 \\Rightarrow \\boxed{E}$ is our solution.\n",

      " Auntie Em won't be able to park only when none of the four available spots touch. We can form a bijection between all such cases and the number of ways to pick four spots out of 13: since none of the spots touch, remove a spot from between each of the cars. From the other direction, given four spots out of 13, simply add a spot between each.\n",
      "So the probability she can park is \\[1-\\frac{{13 \\choose 4}}{{16 \\choose 4}}=1-\\frac{13\\cdot12\\cdot11\\cdot10}{16\\cdot15\\cdot14\\cdot13}=1-\\frac{11}{28}={\\textbf{(E)}\\frac{17}{28}}.\\]  (Bijection: When elements of two sets are perfectly paired with each other, i.e. each and every element from both sets has exactly one match in the other, and no elements are left out. In the context of this problem, this means the number of distinct ways to order the cars such that no two spaces are adjacent is exactly the number of ways to pick 4 spots out of 13.) Instead of trying to park the cars one at a time(considering the number of choices for the first car, then the second, and so on), imagine that all of the cars are already parked, and ignore the empty parking spaces for now. This will take up $12$ parking spaces, illustrated as asterisks: \\[************\\]  We know that 4 spaces must be left empty, and we care about the arrangements where no empty spaces are next to one another. Notice that this is simply the number of ways to put $4$ |s into $13$ slots (including the \"slot\" in front of the first car as well): \\[|*****|*|*|***** \\text{(this works)}\\]  \\[|******||*|***** \\text{(this doesn't)}\\]  In other words, after a space between two cars has been selected to be empty, that space is no longer an option for the next selection. The number of available spaces will decrease by one every time, so we have $13*12*11*10$ ways to arrange the empty spaces. But the empty spaces are identical, so we must divide by the number of orders in which we can place the empty spaces, or $4!$ . This is equivalent to $\\binom{13}{4}$ total ways to arrange $4$ empty spaces into $13$ \"slots\". Then we continue similarly to the above. This solution is pretty similar to the above. So there are 4 spots remaining, and it would be hard to count all the combinations where Auntie Em could park, but you can count all the combinations where Auntie Em can't park. Since the 12 cars are indistinguishable, we can use distributions here. There must be $a_1 \\geq 0$ cars, then an empty spot, then $d_2 \\geq 1$ cars, then an empty spot, then $d_3 \\geq 1$ cars, then an empty spot, then $d_4 \\geq 1$ cars, then an empty spot, then $a_5 \\geq 0$ cars. \\[a_1 + d_2 + d_3 + d_4 + a_5 = 12\\]  To remove all the restrictions, let $a_n = d_n - 1$ . \\[a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 = 9\\]  We can now use stars and bars on these values (9 \"stars\", and 5 - 1 = 4 dividers), to get $\\binom{13}{4}$ possibilities where she can't park. There are $\\binom{16}{4}$ possibilities in total. \\[\\frac{\\binom{13}{4}}{\\binom{16}{4}} = \\frac{11}{28}\\]  Subtracting that from 1 to get the probability she can park, the correct answer is $\\boxed{E}$ .\n",

      " Solution 1 Every factor of $10^n$ will be of the form $2^a \\times 5^b , a\\leq n , b\\leq n$ . Not all of these base ten logarithms will be rational, but we can add them together in a certain way to make it rational. Recall the logarithmic property $\\log(a \\times b) = \\log(a)+\\log(b)$ . For any factor $2^a \\times 5^b$ , there will be another factor $2^{n-a} \\times 5^{n-b}$ . Note this is not true if $10^n$ is a perfect square. When these are multiplied, they equal $2^{a+n-a} \\times 5^{b+n-b} = 10^n$ . $\\log 10^n=n$ so the number of factors divided by 2 times n equals the sum of all the factors, 792. There are $n+1$ choices for the exponent of 5 in each factor, and for each of those choices, there are $n+1$ factors (each corresponding to a different exponent of 2), yielding $(n+1)^2$ total factors. $\\frac{(n+1)^2}{2}*n = 792$ . We then plug in answer choices and arrive at the answer $\\boxed {11}$  Solution 2 We are given \\[\\log_{10}d_1 + \\log_{10}d_2 + \\ldots + \\log_{10}d_k = 792\\] The property $\\log(ab) = \\log(a)+\\log(b)$ now gives \\[\\log_{10}(d_1 d_2\\cdot\\ldots d_k) = 792\\] The product of the divisors is (from elementary number theory) $a^{d(n)/2}$ where $d(n)$ is the number of divisors. Note that $10^n = 2^n\\cdot 5^n$ , so $d(n) = (n + 1)^2$ . Substituting these values with $a = 10^n$ in our equation above, we get $n(n + 1)^2 = 1584$ , from whence we immediately obtain $\\framebox[1.2\\width]{(A)}$ as the correct answer. Solution 3 For every divisor $d$ of $10^n$ , $d \\le \\sqrt{10^n}$ , we have $\\log d + \\log \\frac{10^n}{d} = \\log 10^n = n$ . There are $\\left \\lfloor \\frac{(n+1)^2}{2} \\right \\rfloor$ divisors of $10^n = 2^n \\times 5^n$ that are $\\le \\sqrt{10^n}$ . After casework on the parity of $n$ , we find that the answer is given by $n \\times \\frac{(n+1)^2}{2} = 792 \\Longrightarrow n = 11\\ \\mathrm{(A)}$ . Solution 4 The sum is \\[\\sum_{p=0}^{n}\\sum_{q=0}^{n} \\log(2^p5^q) = \\sum_{p=0}^{n}\\sum_{q=0}^{n}(p\\log(2)+q\\log(5))\\]  \\[= \\sum_{p=0}^{n} ((n+1)p\\log(2) + \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\\log(5))\\]  \\[= \\frac{n(n+1)^2}{2} \\log(2) + \\frac{n(n+1)^2}{2} \\log(5)\\]  \\[= \\frac{n(n+1)^2}{2}\\] Trying for answer choices we get $n=11$  Let integer $d$ be the number of divisors $10^n$ has. Then, we set up $\\frac{d}{2}$ pairs of divisors such that each pair $(a,b)$ satisfies $ab = 10^n$ -- ex. $(1, 10^n), (2, 5*10^{n-1})$ , etc. Then the sum of the base- $10$ logarithms is $\\sum_{j=1}^{\\frac{d}{2}} \\log_{10} a_j + \\log_{10} b_j = \\sum_{j=1}^{\\frac{d}{2}} \\log_{10} a_j b_j = \\sum_{j=1}^{\\frac{d}{2}} \\log_{10} 10^n = \\sum_{j=1}^{\\frac{d}{2}} n = \\frac{nd}{2}$ We can use the property that only perfect squares have an odd number of factors, as for perfect square $p^2$ , we have ordered pair $(p,p)$ that works. For even $n$ , then, $10^{\\frac{n}{2}}$ can be multiplied by itself to get $10^n$ , so $d$ is odd. But, in our summation, $\\frac{d}{2}$ does not exist for even $n$ as $d$ is then odd, so $d$ must be even. And, since $\\frac{nd}{2}$ = $792$ , We want to find a $d$ for our odd options $n$ such that $nd$ = $1584$ . For $n=11$ , $d=144$ works, and integer $d$ can not be found for other odd $n$ . So, we get $\\framebox[1.2\\width]{(A) 11}$  After arriving at the equation $n(n+1)^2 = 1584$ , notice that all of the answer choices are in the form $10+k$ , where $k$ is $1-5$ . We notice that the ones digit of $n(n+1)^2$ is $4$ , and it is dependent on the ones digit of the answer choices. Trying $1-5$ for $n$ , we see that only $1$ yields a ones digit of $4$ , so our answer is $11$ .\n",

The relation above holds for $n=k$ and for $n=k-1$  $(k>1)$ , so \\[\\left(a_k\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)^2-\\left(a_{k-1}\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)^2=\\]  \\[=\\left(\\frac{a_k}{2}+a_{k-1}+a_{k-2}+\\cdots+a_1\\right)-\\left(\\frac{a_{k-1}}{2}+a_{k-2}+a_{k-3}+\\cdots+a_1\\right)\\] Or, \\[a_k-a_{k-1}=\\frac23\\] This implies that each segment of a successive triangle is $\\frac23$ more than the last triangle. To find $a_{1}$ , we merely have to plug in $k=1$ into the aforementioned recursion and we have $a_{1} - a_{0} = \\frac23$ . Knowing that $a_{0}$ is $0$ , we can deduce that $a_{1} = 2/3$ .Thus, $a_n=\\frac{2n}{3}$ , so $A_0A_n=a_n+a_{n-1}+\\cdots+a_1=\\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} = \\frac{n(n+1)}{3}$ . We want to find $n$ so that $n^2<300<(n+1)^2$ . $n=\\boxed{17}$ is our answer. Consider two adjacent equilateral triangles obeying the problem statement. For each, drop an altitude to the $x$ axis and denote the resulting heights $h_n$ and $h_{n+1}$ . From 30-60-90 rules, the distance between the points where these altitudes meet the x-axis is \\[\\frac{h_{n+1}}{\\sqrt{3}}+\\frac{h_n}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{h_{n+1}+h_n}{\\sqrt{3}}\\]  But the square root curve means that this distance is also expressible as $h_{n+1}^2-h_n^2$ (the $x$ coordinates are the squares of the heights). Setting these expressions equal and dividing throughout by $h_{n+1}+h_n$ leaves $h_{n+1}-h_n=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}$ . So the difference in height of successive triangles is $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}$ , meaning their bases are wider by $2/3$ units each time. From here, one can proceed as in Solution 1 to arrive at $n=\\boxed{17}$ . Note that $A_{1}$ is of the form $(2x,0)$ for some $x$ , and thus $B_{1}$ is of the form $(x, x \\sqrt{3}).$ Then, we are told that $B_{1}$ lies on the graph of $y = \\sqrt{x}$ , so \\[(x \\sqrt{3})^{2} = x.\\] Solving for x, we get that $x = \\frac{1}{3},$ and so $A_{1} = (2/3,0)$ . Now, similarly to before, let $|A_{1}A_{2}|=2y.$ Then, $B_{2} = (y+\\frac{2}{3},y \\sqrt{3})$ , and so \\[(y \\sqrt{3})^{2} = (y+\\frac{2}{3}).\\] Solving using the quadratic formula gives \\[y = \\frac{-(-1) \\pm \\sqrt{1^{2}-4(3)(-\\frac{2}{3})}}{6} = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{1^{2}+8}}{6} = \\frac{2}{3}.\\] Then, $2y = \\frac{4}{3},$ so $A_{2} = (2,0).$  In general, if $A_{n} = (a_{n},0)$ for all integers $n$ , and $|A_{n}A_{n+1}| = 2x$ for some real number $x$ , we have the following equation for $x$ : \\[(x \\sqrt{3})^{2} = x+a_{n},\\] which give us when plugged into the quadratic formula gives \\[x = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{1+12a_{n}}}{6},\\] but since $x$ must be positive, we have that \\[x = \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{1+12a_{n}}}{6},\\] and so \\[a_{n+1} = a_{n}+2x = a_{n}+\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{1+12a_{n}}}{3}.\\] Computing a few terms of $a_{n}$ using this method gives $a_{3} = 4,$  $a_{4} = \\frac{20}{3},$ and $a_{5} = 10$ . Notice how all our $a_{n}$ terms so far are rational, even though there is an abundance of radicals in the recurrence. This motivates us to look at our discriminants in the quadratic formula that is solved for $x$ . The discriminant of \\[(x \\sqrt{3})^{2} = x+a_{2}\\] is \\[1+12 \\cdot \\frac{2}{3} = 9.\\] Similarly, the discriminant of \\[(x \\sqrt{3})^{2} = x+a_{3}\\] is $1+12 \\cdot a_{3} = 25,$ and $1+12 \\cdot a_{4} = 49$ . Note how our results keep coming out as the squares of the odd integers. Moreover, it seems that \\[1+12a_{n} = (2n+1)^{2}.\\] We will prove this with induction. The base case, $n=2$ , we have already verified. Now, for the Inductive step, assume that \\[1+12a_{n-1} = (2n-1)^{2}.\\] for some integer $n-1$ . We will prove that this is true for $n$ as well. Plugging this into our recurrence formula gives us \\[a_{n} = a_{n}+2x = a_{n-1}+\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{1+12a_{n-1}}}{3}\\]  \\[a_{n} = \\frac{(2n-1)^{2}-1}{12} + \\frac{1 + (2n-1)}{3}\\]  \\[a_{n} = \\frac{4n^{2}-4n+1-1}{12} + \\frac{8n}{12}\\]  \\[a_{n} = \\frac{4n^{2}+4n+1-1}{12}\\]  \\[a_{n} = \\frac{(2n+1)^{2}-1}{12}.\\] Therefore, we have proved our claim. Now, we have that $|A_{0}A_{n}|=a_{n},$ so we just need the least integer $n$ so that \\[a_{n} > 100,\\] or \\[(2n+1)^{2} > 1201.\\] Then, we see that $35^{2} = 1225$ is the smallest odd square larger than $1201.$ Therefore, we have $2n+1=35$ , so $n = \\boxed{17}.$  -Mr.Sharkman We can iteratively calculate out the first few $A_i$ and $B_i$ . We know that $A_0 = (0,0)$ and the line through $A_0$ and $B_1$ needs to make a $60^{\\circ}$ angle with the x-axis (because the triangle is equilateral). The equation of a line that makes an angle $\\theta$ with the x-axis and passes through the origin has equation $\\tan(\\theta)x$ , so the line through $A_0$ and $B_1$ has equation $\\sqrt{3}x$ . We set this equal to $\\sqrt{x}$ (to find where the two curves intersect) and, when solving, find that $x = \\frac{1}{3}$ . Therefore, $B_1 = (\\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3})$ . By equilateral triangle properties, we must then have that $A_1 = (\\frac{2}{3}, 0)$ . To find $B_2$ , we find the equation of the line through $A_1$ that makes a $60^{\\circ}$ angle with the $x$ -axis. This is the same line as the one through the origin (which we already found) shifted $\\frac{2}{3}$ to the right, so it has equation $y = \\sqrt{3}(x - \\frac{2}{3})$ . Setting this equal to $\\sqrt{x}$ and solving for $x$ , we get $x = \\frac{4}{3}$ , so $B_2 = (\\frac{4}{3}, \\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{3})$ . By equilateral triangle properties, we have that $A_2 = (2, 0)$ . Repeating this process, we find that $B_3 = (3, \\sqrt{3})$ and $A_3 = (4,0)$ . At this point, we notice that the $y$ -coordinate of each $B_i$ is $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}$ more than that of $B_{i-1}$ , so $B_4 = (\\frac{16}{3}, \\frac{4\\sqrt{3}}{3})$ and $A_4 = (\\frac{20}{3}, 0)$ . It may be helpful to continue calculating out the $A_i$ and $B_i$ if the pattern in the $x$ -coordinates of the $A_i$ isn't visible yet. At this point, it can be noticed that the differences between the x coordinates of consecutive $A_i$ form an arithmetic sequence ( $x_{A_1} - x_{A_0} = \\frac{2}{3}$ , $x_{A_2} - x_{A_1} = \\frac{4}{3}$ , etc.). Additionally, the numerator of each of the fractions is a consecutive even number, and the sum of the first $n$ even numbers is $n(n+1)$ . Thus, we must find the least integral solution to $\\frac{n(n+1)}{3} \\geq 100$ . This least solution is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C)}~17}$ . ~ cxsmi \n",

      "To simplify things even more, notice that $90^{\\circ}=\\frac{\\angle D+\\angle A}{2}=180^{\\circ}-\\angle APD$ , so $\\angle P=\\angle Q=90^{\\circ}$ . Also, \\[\\sin(\\angle PAD)=\\sin(\\frac12\\angle XDA)=\\sqrt{\\frac{1-\\cos(\\angle XDA)}{2}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{28}}\\] So the area of $\\triangle APD$ is: \\[R\\cdot c\\sin a\\sin b =\\frac{7\\cdot7}{2}\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{28}}\\sqrt{1-\\frac{3}{28}}=\\frac{35}{8}\\sqrt{3}\\]  Over to the other side: $\\triangle BCY$ is $30-60-90$ , and is therefore congruent to $\\triangle BCQ$ .

So the area is \\[\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{5\\sqrt{3}}{4}(19+9+11+9)=30\\sqrt{3}\\]  2008 AMC 12B 25 II.JPG Let $AP$ and $BQ$ meet $CD$ at $X$ and $Y$ , respectively. Since $\\angle APD=90^{\\circ}$ , $\\angle ADP=\\angle XDP$ , and they share $DP$ , triangles $APD$ and $XPD$ are congruent. By the same reasoning, we also have that triangles $BQC$ and $YQC$ are congruent. Hence, we have $[ABQCDP]=[ABYX]+\\frac{[ABCD]-[ABYX]}{2}=\\frac{[ABCD]+[ABYX]}{2}$ . If we let the height of the trapezoid be $x$ , we have $[ABQCDP]=\\frac{\\frac{11+19}{2}\\cdot x+\\frac{11+7}{2}\\cdot x}{2}=12x$ . Thusly, if we find the height of the trapezoid and multiply it by 12, we will be done. Let the projections of $A$ and $B$ to $CD$ be $A'$ and $B'$ , respectively. We have $DA'+CB'=19-11=8$ , $DA'=\\sqrt{DA^2-AA'^2}=\\sqrt{49-x^2}$ , and $CB'=\\sqrt{CB^2-BB'^2}=\\sqrt{25-x^2}$ . Therefore, $\\sqrt{49-x^2}+\\sqrt{25-x^2}=8$ . Solving this, we easily get that $x=\\frac{5\\sqrt{3}}{2}$ . Multiplying this by 12, we find that the area of hexagon $ABQCDP$ is $30\\sqrt{3}$ , which corresponds to answer choice $\\boxed{B}$ .

By definition, angle bisectors are always equidistant from the sides of the angle, so $P$ is equidistant from $\\overline{AB}$ , $\\overline{AD}$ , and $\\overline{CD}$ .  Likewise, point $Q$ is equidistant from $\\overline{AB}$ , $\\overline{BC}$ , and $\\overline{CD}$ .  Because both points $P$ and $Q$ are equidistant from $\\overline{AB}$ and $\\overline{CD}$ and the distance between $\\overline{AB}$ and $\\overline{CD}$ is constant, the common distances from each of the points to the mentioned segments is equal for $P$ and $Q$ .  Call this distance $x$ . The distance between a point and a line is the length of the segment perpendicular to the line with one endpoint on the line and the other on the point.  This means the altitude from $P$ to $\\overline{AD}$ is $x$ , so the area of $\\triangle ADP$ is equal to $\\frac12\\cdot AD\\cdot x=\\frac72x$ .  Similarly, the area of $\\triangle BCQ$ is $\\frac12\\cdot BC\\cdot x=\\frac52x$ .

We define $r=RD$ and $s=SC$ .  We know that $AB=RS$ , so $RS=11$ and $r+s=19-11=8$ .  By the Pythagorean Theorem on $\\triangle ADR$ and $\\triangle BCS$ , we get $r^2+(2x)^2=7^2$ and $s^2+(2x)^2=5^2$ , respectively.  Subtracting the second equation from the first gives us $r^2-s^2=49-25=24$ .  The left hand side of this equation is a difference of squares and factors to $(r+s)(r-s)$ .  We know that $r+s=8$ , so $r-s=\\frac{24}8=3$ .  Now we can solve for $r$ by adding the two equations we just got to see that $2r=11$ , or $r=\\frac{11}2$ . We now solve for $x$ .

This makes it a perpendicular bisector. The same is true for $DP$ and $AY.$ Thus, $CX = CB = 5,$ and $DY = DA = 7.$ This means $XY = 19 - 5 - 7 = 7.$ We can now find $PQ$ as the midline of $ABXY.$ Thus, $PQ = \\frac{1}{2} (11+7) = 9.$  Now, the answer is simply finding the area of $ABQP$ plus area of $CDPQ.$ This is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{5 \\sqrt{3}}{2} \\cdot \\frac{11+9}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{5 \\sqrt{3}}{2} \\cdot \\frac{19+9}{2}  = \\boxed{30 \\sqrt{3}}.$  ~ MelonGirl\n",

Let the side length of the smaller square be $1$ , and let the smaller side of the rectangles be $y$ . Since the larger square's area is four times larger than the smaller square's, the larger square's side length is $2$ . $2$ is equivalent to $2y+1$ , giving $y=1/2$ . Then, the longer side of the rectangles is $3/2$ . $\\frac{\\frac{3}{2}}{\\frac{1}{2}}=\\boxed{3}$ . Let the longer side length be $x$ , and the shorter side be $a$ .

Notice that $2$ is a prime factor of an integer $n$ if and only if $n$ is even. Therefore, given any sufficiently high positive integral value of $k$ , dividing $I_k$ by $2^6$ yields a terminal digit of zero, and dividing by 2 again leaves us with $2^7 \\cdot a = I_k$ where $a$ is an odd integer.\n",

In fact, 1000064 is the ONLY $N(k)$ that satisfies $7$ .

Factor $2^6$ out of the expression to get $I_k = 2^6(1+2^{k-4}5^{k+2})$ . You can now easily see that $I_k$ is divisible by at least 6 factors of two, from $2^6$ .

Obviously, if $x$ is negative, the expression will be fractional and not contain any extra factors of two. If $x>0$ , the value $15625\\cdot10^x$ will end in a zero. When 1 is added to the expression, the expression will end in 1. Since numbers divisible by 2 end in 0,2,4,6, or 8, the expression is not divisible by 2 and will not contribute to the total. If $x=0$ , the expression evaluates to $15626$ . Dividing out twos, you find that this value is only divisible by one factor of 2. The six factors of two from earlier add to this factor of two to give $\\textbf{(B)}\\ 7\\qquad$  Solution written by coolak  Similar to the other solutions, notice that $I_k$ can be written as $10^{k+2}+64 \\Rightarrow 2^{k+2}5^{k+2}+2^6$ . Factoring out $2^6$ we see that $I_k = 2^6(2^{k-4}5^{k+2}+1)$  Notice that for $k < 4$ , $2^{k-4}$ will not be an integer, and will \"steal\" some $2$ 's from the $2^6$ . We don't want this to happen, since we want to maximize the exponent of $2$ . We start by considering $k = 4$ . Then $I_k = 2^6(*5^6+1) \\Rightarrow 2^6(5^6+1)$  $5^6$ is an odd number; more specifically, it ends in $25$ (all powers of $5$ after $5^1$ end in $25$ ). Therefore the value in the parentheses will be some large number that ends in $26$ . Considering the rules of divisibility, we find that $5^6+1$ is even, so it is divisible by $2$ . Now our exponent of $2$ is at $7$ . But the divisibility rule for $4$ is the last $2$ digits of the number must be divisible by $4$ . We know the last digits: $26$ , which is not divisible by $4$ . Therefore $5^6 + 1$ is divisible by $2$ , but not $4$ . Testing more values of $k$ , we find that for $k \\ge 5$ , the last digit becomes $1$ , which means it is not even divisible by $2$ . Therefore the highest possible exponent of $2$ that we can reach is $7 \\Rightarrow \\boxed{\\text{B}}$ . Let $m=k+2$ . $v_2(10^m+2^6)=6$ if $m>6$ and $v_2(10^m+2^6)=m$ if $m<6$ . \n",
      "However, if $m=6$ , then $v_2(10^6+2^6)=v_2(2^6(5^6+1))=6+v_2(5^6+1)$ . By LTE, $v_2(5^6-1)=v_2(5-1)+v_2(5+1)+v_2(6)-1=2+1+1-1=3$ . Since $v_2(5^6-1)=3$ , $v_2(5^6+1)$ must equal $1$ . So, the answer is $6+1=7 \\Rightarrow \\boxed{\\text{B}}$ \n",

      " In any regular polygon with side length $2$ , consider the isosceles triangle formed by the center of the polygon $S$ and two consecutive vertices $X$ and $Y$ . We are given that $XY=2$ . Obviously $SX=SY=r$ , where $r$ is the radius of the circumcircle. Let $T$ be the midpoint of $XY$ . Then $XT=TY=1$ , and $TS=\\rho$ , where $\\rho$ is the radius of the incircle. Applying the Pythagorean theorem on the triangle $STX$ , we get that $\\rho^2 + 1 = r^2$ . Then the area between the circumcircle and the incircle can be computed as $\\pi r^2 - \\pi \\rho^2 = \\pi r^2 - \\pi (r^2 - 1) = \\pi$ . Hence $A=\\pi$ , $B=\\pi$ , and therefore $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }A=B}$ . Similar to the first solution, consider the isosceles triangle formed by each polygon.  If you drop an altitude to the side of each polygon, you get in both polygons a right triangle with base of $1$ .  For both the pentagon and heptagon, the hypotenuse of these right triangles is the radii of the larger circles and the apothems (the altitude we dropped to the side of each polygon) are the radii of the smaller circles. Label the apothem of the pentagon $A_{1}$ and the apothem of the heptagon $A_{2}$ .  Label the hypotenuse in the pentagon $H_{1}$ and the hypotenuse in the heptagon $H_{2}$ . Now, finding the angles in the triangles and applying trig functions to find these radii, we get the following: $A_{1}$ = $\\cot 36^\\circ$  $A_{2}$ = $\\cot \\frac {180}{7}^\\circ$  $H_{1}$ = $\\csc 36^\\circ$  $H_{2}$ = $\\csc \\frac {180}{7}^\\circ$  Now, the areas in between the circles are: $\\text{Pentagon circles}$ = $\\pi((\\csc 36^\\circ)^2 - (\\cot 36^\\circ)^2)$  $\\text{Heptagon circles}$ = $\\pi((\\csc \\frac {180}{7}^\\circ)^2 - (\\cot \\frac {180}{7}^\\circ)^2)$  Note the trig identity $(\\cot\\theta)^2 +1 = (\\csc\\theta)^2$ , from which we can easily get that $(\\csc\\theta)^2 - (\\cot\\theta)^2 = 1$  Thus, the area between the circles in both the heptagon and the pentagon are equivalent to $\\pi$ , and therefore the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }A=B}$ . Note that the answer choices all include powers of $5$ and $7$ . This indicates that the answer must depend on the number of sides the two shapes have. For simplicity, we solve the same problem with triangle and square instead of pentagon and heptagon. For the triangle setup, $A = \\left(\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)^2 \\cdot \\pi - \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)^2 \\cdot \\pi = \\pi.$ For the square setup, $B = \\left(\\sqrt{2}\\right)^2 \\cdot \\pi - \\left(1\\right)^2 \\cdot \\pi = \\pi.$  Since $A = B$ for the triangle-square case, it should be the same for the pentagon-heptagon case. Therefore, we choose $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) } A=B }$ . ~sirswagger21\n",

      " From the three zeroes, we have $p(x) = (x - (2009 + 9002\\pi i))(x - 2009)(x - 9002)$ . Then $p(x^4) = (x^4 - (2009 + 9002\\pi i))(x^4 - 2009)(x^4 - 9002)=x^{12}+ax^8+bx^4+c$ . Let's do each factor case by case: $x^4 - (2009 + 9002\\pi i) = 0$ : Clearly, all the fourth roots are going to be complex.  $x^4 - 2009 = 0$ : The real roots are $\\pm \\sqrt [4]{2009}$ , and there are two complex roots.  $x^4 - 9002 = 0$ : The real roots are $\\pm \\sqrt [4]{9002}$ , and there are two complex roots.

      " Solution 1 Firstly, note that the intersection of the plane must be a hexagon. Consider the net of the octahedron. Notice that the hexagon becomes a line on the net. Also, notice that, given the parallel to the faces conditions, the line must be parallel to precisely $\\frac{1}{3}$ of the sides of the net. Now, notice that, through symmetry, 2 of the hexagon's vertexes lie on the midpoint of the side of the \"square\" in the octahedron. In the net, the condition gives you that one of the intersections of the line with the net have to be on the midpoint of the side. However, if one is on the midpoint, because of the parallel conditions, all of the vertices are on the midpoint of a side. Thus, we have a regular hexagon with a side length of the midline of an equilateral triangle with side length 1, which is $\\frac{1}{2}$ . Thus, the answer is $\\frac {3\\sqrt {3}}{8}$ , and $a + b + c = 14\\ \\mathbf{(E)}$ . (Can somebody clarify this and provide a diagram?) Solution 2 The plane cuts the octahedron into two congruent solids, which allows us to consider only the cut through the top half (a square pyramid). Because the cut is parallel to one side of the pyramid and must create two congruent solids, we can see that it must take the shape of a trapezoid with right, left, and top sides being 0.5 and a bottom side of 1. This is equivalent to a unit equilateral triangle with the tip cut off at the midpoint. Accordingly, the area of the polygon is $2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\cdot \\frac{3}{4}$ or $\\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{8}$ , and $a + b + c = 14$ .   2009 AMC 12A ( Problems • Answer Key • Resources )   Preceded by Problem 21   Followed by Problem 23    1  •  2  •  3  •  4  •  5  •  6  •  7  •  8  •  9  •  10  •  11  •  12  •  13  •  14  •  15  •  16  •  17  •  18  •  19  •  20  •  21  •  22  •  23  •  24  •  25    All AMC 12 Problems and Solutions  The problems on this page are copyrighted by the Mathematical Association of America 's American Mathematics Competitions .

      " We just look at the last three logarithms for the moment, and use the fact that $\\log_2 T(k) = T(k - 1)$ . We wish to find: \\begin{align*} \\log_2\\log_2\\log_2\\left({T(2009)^{\\left({T(2009)}^{T(2009)}\\right)}}\\right) &= \\log_2(T(2009)\\log_2(T(2009)\\log_2 T(2009)))\\\\ &= \\log_2(T(2009)\\log_2(T(2009)T(2008)))\\\\ &= \\log_2 \\{ T(2009) [ T(2008) + T(2007) ] \\} \\\\ \\end{align*}  Now we realize that $T(n - 1)$ is much smaller than $T(n)$ . So we approximate this, remembering we have rounded down, as: \\[\\log_2(T(2009)) = T(2008)\\] We have used $3$ logarithms so far. Applying $2007$ more to the left of our expression, we get $T(1) = 2$ . Then we can apply the logarithm $2$ more times, until we get to $0$ . So our answer is approximately $3 + 2007 + 2 = 2012$ . But we rounded down, so that means that after $2012$ logarithms we get a number slightly greater than $0$ , so we can apply logarithms one more time. We can be sure it is small enough so that the logarithm can only be applied $1$ more time since $2012 + 1 = 2013$ is the largest answer choice. So the answer is $\\mathbf{(E)}$ . EDIT: Why use answer choices? @above solution should explain at the end WHY they can be sure. Let $L_k(x)=\\log_2\\log_2...\\log_2(x)$ where there are $k$  $\\log_2$ 's. $L_k(B)$ is defined iff (if and only if) $L_{k-1}(B) > 0$ iff $L_{k-2}(B) > 1$ . Note $\\log_2 T(k) = T(k - 1)$ , so $L_{k-2}(T(k-2))=1$ . Thus, we seek the largest $k$ such that $B > T(k-2)$ . Now note that $T(2009)^{T(2009)^{T(2009)}} > 2^{2^{T(2009)}} = T(2011)$  so $k=2013$ satisfies the inequality. Since it is the largest choice, it is the answer. (Note: This for the people who need clear, concise reasoning in the form of mostly words, instead of a compact proof written in set theory symbols and the like. I figured if I had trouble understanding the above solutions, others would too.) We begin by contemplating what $B$ actually is. Calculating the first few values of $T(n)$ , we see that it quickly becomes absolutely, massively, well, MASSIVE. So actually calculating $T(2009)$ , is sadly, not an option (this is a final five problem, after all). Next we consider if it is possible to express $B$ differently. We have:  $B = T(2009)^{T(2009)^{T(2009)}} \\Rightarrow \\text{calculating.... ERROR}$  (I didn't actually try plug it into a computer program; the point is, it's not that easy) So, the only thing left to do is jump right into the problem. We start by applying the $\\log$ s one at a time, and seeing where it goes. We have:  $\\log_2{\\left(T(2009)^{\\left(T(2009)^{T(2009)}\\right)}\\right)}$  (Uhhhhhh....) But wait! We can use the rule $\\log_b{x^y} = y*\\log_b{x}$ . Then the expression becomes  $(T(2009)^{T(2009)}*\\log_2{T(2009)} \\Rightarrow (T(2009)^{T(2009)}*T(2008)$  (because $\\log_2{T(n)} = {T(n-1)}$ ) Now we try $\\log$ ing it again:  $\\log_2{(T(2009)^{T(2009)}*T(2008)}$ . This time, we can make use of the $\\log$ addition rule $\\log_b{x*y} = \\log_b{x}+\\log_b{y}$ . The expression becomes  $\\log_2{(T(2009)^{T(2009)})} + \\log_2{T(2008)}$  Pulling out the exponent again and further simplifying, we have  $\\log_2{(\\log_2{(B)})} = T(2009)*T(2008)+T(2007)$  Now we $\\log$ it a third time... and we're stuck 😐. There is no pretty formula for taking the $\\log$ of two things added together. So we rack our brains, sigh in frustration... and give up. JUST KIDDING! (Don't give up) Whenever you get stuck, you want to \"zoom out\" and re-gain perspective of what it is you're actually trying to find. The problem asks us to find the number of times we can keep taking the $\\log$ of this expression, until we no longer can (once you reach a negative value, you can't take the log of it anymore; i.e. $\\log$ s are only defined for positive inputs). So, for the context of this problem, what we want to know is: \"How many times can I take the $\\log$ of $B$ and get a positive value?\" Let's think about what $\\log$ actually means. We want a number $x$ , such that when $2$ is raised to the power of $x$ , we get the expression in the $\\log$ . So, when we think about  $\\log_2{T(2009)*T(2008)+T(2007)}$  What actually matters? Well, even if you have a big number, say, $124986068$ , what happens when you raise $2$ to the power of that number? We would end up getting another one of these: Calculating... ERROR (lol 🤣) But in all seriousness, whenever we consider tower functions, the next tower number is always much, much bigger. So, back to the problem:  $\\log_2{(T(2009)*T(2008)+T(2007))}$   $T(2007)$ is huge... but when you put it next to $T(2008)$ , it looks like an ant. Even more so when it's next to $T(2009)*T(2008)$ . So... what does that mean? Well, if we could get rid of the $T(2007)$ , we could at least go another step. So... let's get rid of it! (At this point I can almost see the audience: *surprised pikachu face) \\[\\text{WARNING: THIS SECTION IS FOR CALCULUS USERS ONLY}\\]  (Just kidding, but yes, the following part of the explanation does incorporate some calculus-related ideas) If we were to consider just  $\\log_2{(T(2009)*T(2008))}$  we would get  $\\log_2{T(2009)} + \\log_2{T(2008)} \\Rightarrow T(2008) + T(2007)$  But what if we wanted to get  $T(2008) + T(2007)+1$  as our answer? What would the argument have to be? (In this context, \"argument\" refers to the value in the parentheses). Well, we can work backwards:  $T(2008) + T(2007)+1$  $\\Rightarrow \\log_2{T(2009)} + \\log_2{T(2008)} + \\log_2{2}$  $\\Rightarrow \\log_2{(T(2009)*T(2008)*2)}$  So the argument would have to be at least  $2*T(2009)*T(2008) = T(2009)*T(2008)+T(2009)*T(2008)$  But when we compare  $T(2009)*T(2008)+T(2009)*T(2008)$  to $T(2009)*T(2008)+T(2007)$  Clearly  $T(2009)*T(2008) > T(2007)$  So,  $\\log_2{(T(2009)*T(2008)+T(2007))}$  equals some value between  $T(2008) + T(2007)$  and $T(2008) + T(2007) + 1$  Let's call that small excess value $\\varepsilon$ (lowercase epsilon, literally \"infinitely small but not 0\"). We want to keep taking the $\\log$ of the expression, and $\\varepsilon$ is going to be pitifully small compared to $T(2008)$ or $T(2007)$ . So, within the context of this problem,  $T(2008) + T(2007) + \\varepsilon \\approx T(2008) + T(2007)$  Now we take the $\\log$ again:  $\\log_2{(T(2008)+T(2007))}$  Look familiar? It should, because this is almost exactly the same scenario as the one I just made a big fuss about (Take that, you no-know-calculus noobs! On an off note, it's completely fine if you don't know calculus; AMC problems are supposed to solvable by students who don't know calculus.) So, applying the same idea as earlier we have  $\\log_2{(T(2008)+T(2007))} \\approx \\log_2{T(2008)}$  From here on out, it's calm waters. To recap,  $\\log_2{(\\log_2{(\\log_2{(B)})})} \\approx T(2008)$  Taking the $\\log$  $2007$ more times(for a total of $2010$ ), we get  $\\log_2\\log_2... T(2008) = T(1) = 2$  Taking the log again, we get  $\\log_2{2} = 1$  (Now we're at $2011$ times) Once more and we have  $\\log_2{1} = 0$ . ( $2012$ times) But wait, there's more! (IYKYK lol) Remember how we ignored the $\\varepsilon$ ? Well, It's time to bring it back. Every time we took the log, we would get $T(\\text{something})$ + $\\varepsilon$ because we defined $\\varepsilon$ to be some very, very small (but finite) number. Let's go back a few steps:  $\\log_2{2} = 1$  should really be  $\\log_2{(2+\\varepsilon)} = 1+\\epsilon$  and  $\\log_2{1} = 0$  should really be  $\\log_2{(1+\\varepsilon)} = \\varepsilon$  Since $\\varepsilon$ is still a positive number, we can take the $\\log$ of it one last time before it becomes negative. So, after a long and very tiring journey (for both you, the reader, and me, the writer) we have $k$ (the number of times we took the $\\log$ ) $= 2013 \\Rightarrow \\boxed{\\text{E}}$ .\n",

Now consider another sequence $\\{b_1, b_2, b_3...\\}$ such that $b_n = \\theta_n/15$ , and $0 \\leq b_n < 12$ . The sequence $b_n$ satisfies $b_1 = 3, b_2 = 2, b_{n + 2} \\equiv b_{n + 1} + b_n \\pmod{12}$ . As the number of possible consecutive two terms is finite, we know that the sequence $b_n$ is periodic. Write out the first few terms of the sequence until it starts to repeat. $\\{b_n\\} = \\{3,2,5,7,0,7,7,2,9,11,8,7,3,10,1,11,0,11,11,10,9,7,4,11,3,2,5,7,...\\}$  Note that $b_{25} = b_1 = 3$ and $b_{26} = b_2 = 2$ . Thus $\\{b_n\\}$ has a period of $24$ : $b_{n + 24} = b_n$ . It follows that $b_{2009} = b_{17} = 0$ and $\\theta_{2009} = 15 b_{2009} = 0$ . Thus $a_{2009} = \\tan{\\theta_{2009}} = \\tan{0} = 0.$  Our answer is $|a_{2009}| = \\boxed{\\textbf{(A)}\\ 0}$ . First, some intuition. The given recurrence relation: $a_{n + 2} = \\frac {a_n + a_{n + 1}}{1 - a_na_{n + 1}}$ looks much like the tangent addition formula. So, we let $a_n=\\tan{\\theta_n}$ . Then, we get: \\[\\tan{\\theta_n}=\\tan{(\\theta_{n-1}+\\theta_{n-2})}\\] This gives us: \\[\\theta_n \\equiv \\theta_{n-1}+\\theta_{n-2} \\pmod{180}\\] Now, observe that \\[\\theta_1=45\\]  \\[\\theta_2=30\\] We know that this sequence of values for $\\theta_n$ will repeat eventually because it is mod $180$ .\n",
      "It is just a matter of when, so we start bashing: \\[\\theta_3=75\\]  \\[\\theta_4=105\\]  \\[\\theta_5=0\\]  \\[\\theta_6=105\\]  \\[\\theta_7=105\\]  \\[\\theta_8=30\\]  \\[\\theta_9=135\\]  \\[\\theta_{10}=165\\]  \\[\\theta_{11}=120\\]  \\[\\theta_{12}=105\\]  \\[\\theta_{13}=45\\]  \\[\\theta_{14}=150\\]  \\[\\theta_{15}=15\\]  \\[\\theta_{16}=165\\]  \\[\\theta_{17}=0\\]  \\[\\theta_{18}=165\\]  \\[\\theta_{19}=165\\]  \\[\\theta_{20}=150\\]  \\[\\theta_{21}=135\\]  \\[\\theta_{22}=105\\]  \\[\\theta_{23}=60\\]  \\[\\theta_{24}=165\\]  \\[\\theta_{25}=45\\]  \\[\\theta_{26}=30\\] And there is the repetition. So, this series has a period of 24. $2009 \\equiv 17 \\pmod{24}$ , so $|a_{2009}|=|\\tan{\\theta_{17}}|=|\\tan{0}|=|0|= \\boxed{\\textbf{(A)}\\ 0}$ ~Firebolt360 (While the above solution is quite intuitive, it's kinda hard for people who don't know many proofing symbols to understand.) Notice that the formula given in the problem looks incredibly similar to the Tangent Addition Formula .\n",
      "Since $a_1 = 1$ , let $a_1$ be $\\tan{45}$ . Similarly, let $a_2$ be $\\tan{30}$ . Then the formula for $a_3$ reads  \\[a_3 = \\frac {\\tan{45} + \\tan{30} }{1 - \\tan{45}*\\tan{30}}.\\] But from the Tangent Addition Formula we know that this is just the formula for $\\tan{(45+30)}$ or $\\tan{75}$ , meaning $a_3 = \\tan{75}$ . So, the sequence becomes a sort of Fibonacci sequence with angle measures. We continue to sum angle measures, like so:  $a_4 = \\tan{(75+30)} = \\tan{105}$   $a_5 = \\tan{(105+75)} = \\tan{180}$   $a_6 = \\tan{(180+105)} =$ ... wait a minute! $\\tan{180} = \\tan{0}$ ! So now we have  $a_5 = \\tan{0}$   $a_6 = \\tan{(105+0)} = \\tan{105}$   $a_7 = \\tan{(105+105)} = \\tan{210}$   $a_8 = \\tan{(210+105)} =$ .... Ok this is getting tiring. Let's stop and think about whether we can simplify this. Notice that all of the angle measures are a multiple of $15$ . So, let's express the angle measures as multiples of $15$ . Let $b_n = \\frac{\\arctan{(a_n)}}{15}$ . (Basically, $b_n$ is the angle measure of the corresponding $a_n,$ divided by $15$ ) Now we have  $b_1 = 3$   $b_2 = 2$   $b_3 = 5$   $b_4 = 7$   $b_5 = 12$  But wait... we're dealing with the $\\tan$ function, which has a period (recurrence rate) of $2\\pi$ or $180^{\\circ}$ . Since we divided the angle measures by $15$ , the period is now $12$ (which aligns with what we got earlier: $a_5 = 0$ ). This means that we can reduce the terms of the sequence based on the $\\bmod$ function, which returns the remainder after dividing by a certain amount. So now we can say $b_n \\equiv b_n \\bmod{12}$ ( $\\equiv$ denotes modular equivalence in this context). Now we continue our sequence: $3, 2, 5, 7, 0, 7, 7, 2, 9, 11, 8, 7, 3, 10, 1, 11, 0, 11, 11, 10, 9, 7, 4, 11, 3, 2, 5$ (It's starting to repeat now) So $a_1  = 3, a_{25} = 3, a_{49} = 3$ , and so on. The sequence repeats every $24$ terms. The problem asks us for the value of $a_{2009}$ . Let's whip out the $\\bmod$ function again.  $2009 \\bmod 24 = 17$  So we want the value of the $17$ th number in the sequence, and looking back at it (hopefully you wrote it down somewhere) we find that $b_{17} = 0 \\Rightarrow \\boxed{\\text{A}}$ . https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tic0ehB6TU4    2009 AMC 12A ( Problems • Answer Key • Resources )   Preceded by Problem 24   Followed by Last question    1  •  2  •  3  •  4  •  5  •  6  •  7  •  8  •  9  •  10  •  11  •  12  •  13  •  14  •  15  •  16  •  17  •  18  •  19  •  20  •  21  •  22  •  23  •  24  •  25    All AMC 12 Problems and Solutions  The problems on this page are copyrighted by the Mathematical Association of America 's American Mathematics Competitions .

      " Solution 1 For $c\\geq 1.5$ the shaded area is at most $1.5$ , which is too little. Hence $c<1.5$ , and therefore the point $(2,1)$ is indeed inside the shaded part, as shown in the picture. Then the area of the shaded part is one less than the area of the triangle with vertices $(c,0)$ , $(3,0)$ , and $(3,3)$ . The area of the entire triangle is $\\frac{3(3-c)}2$ , therefore the area of the shaded part is $\\frac{7-3c}{2}$ . The entire figure has area $5$ , hence we want the shaded part to have area $\\frac 52$ . Solving for $c$ , we get $c=\\boxed{\\frac 23}$ .  The answer is $\\mathrm{(C)}$ . Solution 2 The unit square is of area 1, so the five unit squares have area 5.\n",
      "Therefore the shaded space must occupy 2.5. The missing unit square is of area 1, and if reconstituted the original triangle would be of area 3.5.\n",
      "It can then be inferred: $(3-c) * 3 = 7$ . $3-c=\\frac{7}{3}$ , so $3-\\frac{7}{3}=c$ . $3-\\frac{7}{3} = \\frac{9-7}{3} = \\frac{2}{3}$ . $\\boxed{\\mathrm{(C)}}$ . Solution 3 The shaded space of the object can become a triangle by adding a unit square to its bottom. This triangle has a base length of $3-c$ and a height of $3$ . The area of this triangle region is now (using the formula $A=bh/2$ for a triangle) $(9-3c)/2$ . But, remember that we have to subtract the area of the extra unit square from this area to get the area of the shaded region. If you add 3 unit squares to the top of the unshaded portion, the figure is now a right trapezoid. Using the formula for a trapezoid, you can derive that its area is $(9+3c)/2$ . After you subtract the area of the 3 extra unit squares, we have derived the area of the unshaded portion. Since these areas are both equal, we set them equal to each other and solve for $c$ . $(9-3c)/2 -1 = (9+3c)/2 -3$ . $c$ is now solved to be $\\frac{2}{3}$ . $\\boxed{\\mathrm{(C)}}$ . ~Solution by athens2016 Solution 4 (Brute Force) We are looking for the area of the shaded region to be $\\frac 52$ .

      " (B) Intuitively, $x$ will be largest for that option for which the value in the parentheses is smallest. Formally, first note that each of the values in parentheses is larger than $1$ . Now, each of the options is of the form $3f(r)^x = 7$ . This can be rewritten as $x\\log f(r) = \\log\\frac 73$ . As $f(r)>1$ , we have $\\log f(r)>0$ . Thus $x$ is the largest for the option for which $\\log f(r)$ is smallest. And as $\\log f(r)$ is an increasing function, this is the option for which $f(r)$ is smallest. We now get the following easier problem: Given that $0<r<3$ , find the smallest value in the set $\\{ 1+r, 1+r/10, 1+2r, 1+\\sqrt r, 1+1/r\\}$ . Clearly $1+r/10$ is smaller than the first and the third option. We have $r^2 < 10$ , dividing both sides by $10r$ we get $r/10 < 1/r$ . And finally, $r/100 < 1$ , therefore $r^2/100 < r$ , and as both sides are positive, we can take the square root and get $r/10 < \\sqrt r$ . Thus the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) } 3\\left(1+\\frac{r}{10}\\right)^x = 7}$ . As stated in the first solution, $x$ will be largest when the value in the parenthesis is smallest.

      " Solution 1 To find the answer it was enough to play around with $f$ . One can easily find that $f(1)=41$ is a prime, then $f$ becomes negative for $n$ between $2$ and $18$ , and then $f(19)=761$ is again a prime number. And as $41 + 761 = 802$ is already the largest option, the answer must be $\\boxed{802}$ . Solution 2 We will now show a complete solution, with a proof that no other values are prime. Consider the function $g(x) = x^2 - 360x + 400$ , then obviously $f(x) = g(x^2)$ . The roots of $g$ are: \\[x_{1,2}  = \\frac{ 360 \\pm \\sqrt{ 360^2 - 4\\cdot 400 } }2  = 180 \\pm 80 \\sqrt 5\\]  We can then write $g(x) = (x - 180 - 80\\sqrt 5)(x - 180 + 80\\sqrt 5)$ , and thus $f(x) = (x^2 - 180 - 80\\sqrt 5)(x^2 - 180 + 80\\sqrt 5)$ . We would now like to factor the right hand side further, using the formula $(x^2 - y^2) = (x-y)(x+y)$ . To do this, we need to express both constants as squares of some other constants. Luckily, we have a pretty good idea how they look like. We are looking for rational $a$ and $b$ such that $(a+b\\sqrt 5)^2 = 180 + 80\\sqrt 5$ . Expanding the left hand side and comparing coefficients, we get $ab=40$ and $a^2 + 5b^2 = 180$ . We can easily guess (or compute) the solution $a=10$ , $b=4$ . Hence $180 + 80\\sqrt 5 = (10 + 4\\sqrt 5)^2$ , and we can easily verify that also $180 - 80\\sqrt 5 = (10 - 4\\sqrt 5)^2$ . We now know the complete factorization of $f(x)$ : \\[f(x) = (x - 10 - 4\\sqrt 5)(x + 10 + 4\\sqrt 5)(x - 10 + 4\\sqrt 5)(x + 10 - 4\\sqrt 5)\\]  As the final step, we can now combine the factors in a different way, in order to get rid of the square roots. We have $(x - 10 - 4\\sqrt 5)(x - 10 + 4\\sqrt 5) = (x-10)^2 - (4\\sqrt 5)^2 = x^2 - 20x + 20$ ,\n",
      "and $(x + 10 - 4\\sqrt 5)(x + 10 + 4\\sqrt 5) = x^2 + 20x + 20$ . Hence we obtain the factorization $f(x) = (x^2 - 20x + 20)(x^2 + 20x + 20)$ . For $x\\geq 20$ both terms are positive and larger than one, hence $f(x)$ is not prime. For $1<x<19$ the second factor is positive and the first one is negative, hence $f(x)$ is not a prime. The remaining cases are $x=1$ and $x=19$ . In both cases, $f(x)$ is indeed a prime, and their sum is $f(1) + f(19) = 41 + 761 = \\boxed{802}$ . Solution 3 Instead of doing the hard work, we can try to guess the factorization. One good approach: We can make the observation that $f(x)$ looks similar to $(x^2 + 20)^2$ with the exception of the $x^2$ term. In fact, we have $(x^2 + 20)^2 = x^4 + 40x^2 + 400$ . But then we notice that it differs from the desired expression by a square: $f(x) = (x^2 + 20)^2 - 400x^2 = (x^2 + 20)^2 - (20x)^2$ . Now we can use the formula $(x^2 - y^2) = (x-y)(x+y)$ to obtain the same factorization as in the previous solution, without all the work. Solution 4 After arriving at the factorization $f(x) = (x^2 - 20x + 20)(x^2 + 20x + 20)$ , a more mathematical approach would be to realize that the second factor is always positive when $x$ is a positive integer. Therefore, in order for $f(x)$ to be prime, the first factor has to be $1$ . We can set it equal to 1 and solve for $x$ : $x^2-20x+20=1$  $x^2-20x+19=0$  $(x-1)(x-19)=0$  $x=1, x=19$  Substituting these values into the second factor and adding would give the answer.\n",

Clearly, $\\boxed{89}$ is the only fibonacci number, so no calculation is needed for this problem. Let $S_n$ be the number of possible seating arrangements with $n$ women. Consider $n \\ge 3,$ and focus on the rightmost woman. If she returns back to her seat, then there are $S_{n-1}$ ways to seat the remaining $n-1$ women. If she sits in the second to last seat, then the woman who previously sat there must now sit at the rightmost seat. This gives us $S_{n-2}$ ways to seat the other $n-2$ women, so we obtain the recursion \\[S_n = S_{n-1}+S_{n-2}.\\]  Starting with $S_1=1$ and $S_2=2,$ we can calculate $S_{10}=\\boxed{89}.$  The seating possibilities of woman # $10$ become the two cases which we work out. $S_n$ was defined to be the number of different seating arrangements with $n$ women. In the first \"case\" if woman # $10$ sits in the seat # $10$ , this leads to a similar scenario, but with $9$ women instead. That means that for this case, there are a total of $S_{9}$ possible arrangements. We don't know how many exactly, but we are able to define it in terms of $S$ . During the second \"case\", woman # $10$ sits in seat # $9$ . This time, woman #9 must go to seat # $10$ , as she is the only other person who can go there. This leaves us with $8$ women, and we again represent this in terms of $S \\Rightarrow S_8$ . Therefore, we can write $S_{10}$ in terms of $S_8$ and $S_9$ , like so: \\[S_{10} = S_8 + S_9.\\]  We can then generalize this to say \\[S_n = S_{n-1}+S_{n-2}.\\]  Calculating $S_1 = 1$ and $S_2 =2,$ then following the recursive rule from above, we get $S_{10} = 89 \\Rightarrow \\boxed{\\text{A}}$ .\n",

      " Solution 1 The area of any parallelogram $ABCD$ can be computed as the size of the vector product of $\\overrightarrow{AB}$ and $\\overrightarrow{AD}$ . In our setting where $A=(0,0)$ , $B=(s,s)$ , and $D=(t,kt)$ this is simply $s\\cdot kt - s\\cdot t = (k-1)st$ . In other words, we need to count the triples of integers $(k,s,t)$ where $k>1$ , $s,t>0$ and $(k-1)st = 1,\\!000,\\!000 = 2^6 5^6$ . These can be counted as follows: We have $6$ identical red balls (representing powers of $2$ ), $6$ blue balls (representing powers of $5$ ), and three labeled urns (representing the factors $k-1$ , $s$ , and $t$ ). The red balls can be distributed in ${8\\choose 2} = 28$ ways, and for each of these ways, the blue balls can then also be distributed in $28$ ways. (See Distinguishability for a more detailed explanation.) Thus there are exactly $28^2 = 784$ ways how to break $1,\\!000,\\!000$ into three positive integer factors, and for each of them we get a single parallelogram. Hence the number of valid parallelograms is $784 \\longrightarrow \\boxed{C}$ . Solution 2 Without the vector product the area of $ABCD$ can be computed for example as follows: If $B=(s,s)$ and $D=(t,kt)$ , then clearly $C=(s+t,s+kt)$ . Let $B'=(s,0)$ , $C'=(s+t,0)$ and $D'=(t,0)$ be the orthogonal projections of $B$ , $C$ , and $D$ onto the $x$ axis. Let $[P]$ denote the area of the polygon $P$ . We can then compute: \\begin{align*} [ABCD] & = [ADD'] + [DD'C'C] - [BB'C'C] - [ABB'] \\\\ & = \\frac{kt^2}2 + \\frac{s(s+2kt)}2 - \\frac{t(2s+kt)}2 - \\frac{s^2}2 \\\\ & = kst - st \\\\ & = (k-1)st. \\end{align*} The remainder of the solution is the same as the above.  We know that $A$ is $(0, 0)$ . Since $B$ is on the line $y=x$ , let it be represented by the point $(b, b)$ . Similarly, let $D$ be $(d, kd)$ . Since this is a parallelogram, sides $\\overline{AD}$ and $\\overline{BC}$ are parallel. Therefore, the distance and relative position of $D$ to $A$ is equivalent to that of $C$ to $B$ (if we take the translation of $A$ to $D$ and apply it to $B$ , we will get the coordinates of $C$ ). This yields $C (b+d, b+kd)$ . Using the Shoelace Theorem we get  $1,000,000 = \\frac{1}{2}|\\left(b(b+kd) + (b+d)(kd)\\right) - \\left(b(b+d) + (b+kd)d\\right)|$   $\\Rightarrow 2,000,000 = |2kbd - 2bd|$   $\\Rightarrow 1,000,000 = |kbd - bd|$  Since $k > 1, kbd > bd$ . The equation becomes  $1,000,000 = (k-1)bd$   $\\Rightarrow \\frac{1,000,000}{k-1} = bd$  Since $k$ must be a positive integer greater than $1$ , we know $k-1$ will be a positive integer. We also know that $bd$ is an integer, so $k-1$ must be a factor of $1,000,000$ . Therefore $bd$ will also be a factor of $1,000,000$ . Notice that $1,000,000 = 10^6 = 2^6*5^6$ . Let $b$ be $2^x5^y$ such that $x, y$ are integers on the interval $[0, 6]$ . Let $d$ be $2^w5^z$ such that $w, z$ are integers, $x+w \\le 6$ , and $y+z \\le 6$ . For a pair $(x, y)$ , there are $7-x$ possibilities for $w$ and $7-y$ possibilites for $z$ ( $d$ doesn't have to be the co-factor of $1,000,000$ , it just can't be big enough such that $bd > 1,000,000$ ), for a total of $(7-x)(7-y)$ possibilities. So we want  $\\sum_{k=0, i=0}^6 (7-k)(7-i)$   $\\left(\\text{the sum of the number of possible pairs}(w, z) \\text{ for all pairs}(k , i)\\text{ for } k[0, 6]\\text{ and } i[0, 6]\\right)$  Notice that if we \"fix\" the value of $k$ , at, say $6$ , then run through all of the values of $i$ , change the value of $k$ to $5$ , and run through all of the values of $i$ again, and so on until we exhaust all $49$ combinations of $(k, i)$ we get something like this:  $1*1 + 1*2 + ... + 1*6 + 1*7 + 2*1 + 2*2 + ... + 2*6 + 2*7 + ..... + 7*1 + 7*2 + ... + 7*6 + 7*7$  which can be rewritten  $1(1+2+...+7)+2(1+2+...+7)+.....+7(1+2+...+7)$   $\\Rightarrow (1+2+...+7)(1+2+...+7)$   $\\Rightarrow 28^2$   $\\Rightarrow 784$  So there are $784$ possible sets of coordinates $B,$  $C$ , and $D \\Rightarrow \\boxed{\\text{C}}$ . Note: this solution could be greatly simplified by using the Shoelace Formula on the triangle $ABD$ , which we know has half the area of the parallelogram. This eliminates the need to find the coordinates of point $C$ . (Notational note: I'm not sure if the notation for double index summation is correct or even applicable in the context of this problem. If someone could fix the notation so that it is correct, or replace it without changing the general content of this solution, that would be great. If the notation is correct, then just delete this footnote)\n",

      " First, turn $\\frac34 + \\frac34i$ into polar form as $\\frac{3\\sqrt{2}}{4}e^{\\frac{\\pi}{4}i}$ . Restated using geometric probabilities, we are trying to find the portion of a square enlarged by a factor of $\\frac{3\\sqrt{2}}{4}$ and rotated $45$ degrees that lies within the original square. This skips all the absolute values required before. Finish with the symmetry method stated above. -asdf334  We multiply $z$ and $(\\frac{3}{4}+\\frac{3}{4}i)$ to get \\[(\\frac{3}{4}x-\\frac{3}{4}y)+(\\frac{3}{4}xi+\\frac{3}{4}yi).\\] Since we want to find the probability that this number is in $S$ , we need the real and complex coefficients of this number to be less than or equal to $1$ or greater than or equal to $-1.$ This gives us the equations \\[-1\\le \\frac{3}{4}x-\\frac{3}{4}y \\le 1\\] and \\[-1\\le \\frac{3}{4}x+\\frac{3}{4}y\\le 1.\\] Now, we see that we can solve this by graphing. We can graph our barriers $-1\\le x\\le 1$ and $-1\\le y\\le 1$ to form a $2$ by $2$ square centered at the origin. Graphing our two equations gives us the four lines \\[x-y=\\frac{4}{3},\\]  \\[x-y=-\\frac{4}{3},\\]  \\[x+y=\\frac{4}{3},\\]  \\[x+y=-\\frac{4}{3}.\\] The square that is formed is the region that satisfies these four equations. Now, the barriers and this square gives us an octagon as the desired region. The area of this octagon is the total area of the square minus the 4 small triangles on each corner, each with $\\frac{2}{9}$ area. Therefore, the octagon has area of $\\frac{28}{9}.$ Finally, to find the probability of it working, we find the area of the octagon divided by the area of the entire square which is $\\frac{\\frac{28}{9}}{4}=\\frac{7}{9}$ or $\\boxed{D}.$  -jeteagle\n",

      " First of all, we have to agree on the range of $\\sin^{-1}$ and $\\cos^{-1}$ . This should have been a part of the problem statement -- but as it is missing, we will assume the most common definition: $\\forall x: -\\pi/2 \\leq \\sin^{-1}(x) \\leq \\pi/2$ and $\\forall x: 0\\leq \\cos^{-1}(x) \\leq \\pi$ . Hence we get that $\\forall x\\in[0,\\pi]: \\cos^{ - 1}(\\cos x) = x$ , thus our equation simplifies to $\\sin^{ - 1}(\\sin 6x) = x$ . Consider the function $f(x) = \\sin^{ - 1}(\\sin 6x)  - x$ . We are looking for roots of $f$ on $[0,\\pi]$ . By analyzing properties of $\\sin$ and $\\sin^{-1}$ (or by computing the derivative of $f$ ) one can discover the following properties of $f$ : $f(0)=0$ .  $f$ is increasing and then decreasing on $[0,\\pi/6]$ .  $f$ is decreasing and then increasing on $[\\pi/6,2\\pi/6]$ .  $f$ is increasing and then decreasing on $[2\\pi/6,3\\pi/6]$ . For $x=\\pi/6$ we have $f(x) = \\sin^{-1} (\\sin \\pi) - \\pi/6 = -\\pi/6 < 0$ . Hence $f$ has exactly one root on $(0,\\pi/6)$ . For $x=2\\pi/6$ we have $f(x) = \\sin^{-1} (\\sin 2\\pi) - 2\\pi/6 = -2\\pi/6 < 0$ . Hence $f$ is negative on the entire interval $[\\pi/6,2\\pi/6]$ . Now note that $\\forall t: \\sin^{-1}(t) \\leq \\pi/2$ . Hence for $x > 3\\pi/6$ we have $f(x) < 0$ , and we can easily check that $f(3\\pi/6)<0$ as well. Thus the only unknown part of $f$ is the interval $(2\\pi/6,3\\pi/6)$ . On this interval, $f$ is negative in both endpoints, and we know that it is first increasing and then decreasing. Hence there can be zero, one, or two roots on this interval. To prove that there are two roots, it is enough to find any $x$ from this interval such that $f(x)>0$ . A good guess is its midpoint, $x=5\\pi/12$ , where the function $\\sin^{-1}(\\sin 6x)$ has its local maximum. We can evaluate: $f(x) = \\sin^{-1}(\\sin 5\\pi/2) - 5\\pi/12 = \\pi/2 - 5\\pi/12 = \\pi/12 > 0$ . Summary: The function $f$ has $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }4}$ roots on $[0,\\pi]$ : the first one is $0$ , the second one is in $(0,\\pi/6)$ , and the last two are in $(2\\pi/6,3\\pi/6)$ . Actual solutions are $x=0$ , $x=\\pi/7$ , $x=2\\pi/5$ , and $x=3\\pi/7$ . Since $0\\leq \\cos^{-1}(a) \\leq \\pi$ for all $a$ , the equation reduces to $\\sin^{-1}(\\sin(6x)) = x$ . Since $-\\pi/2 \\leq \\sin^{-1}(a) \\leq \\pi/2$ for all $a$ , $0 \\leq x \\leq \\pi/2$ . To make the problem easier, we will measure angles in degrees. We will consider each sixth of the interval $[0, 90]$ . For $0 \\leq x \\leq 15$ , $6x$ is in the first quadrant. Thus, $\\sin^{-1}(\\sin(6x)) = 6x$ . Setting this equal to $x$ yields the solution $x = 0$ . For $15 \\leq x \\leq 30$ , $6x$ is in the second quadrant. Thus, $\\sin^{-1}(\\sin(6x)) = 180 - 6x$ . This yields the solution $x = \\frac{180}7$ . For $30 \\leq x \\leq 45$ , $6x$ is in the third quadrant. Thus, $\\sin^{-1}(\\sin(6x)) = 180 - 6x$ . As $\\frac{180}{7}$ is not on the interval $30 \\leq x \\leq 45$ , this yields no solution. For $45 \\leq x \\leq 60$ , $6x$ is in the fourth quadrant. Thus, $\\sin^{-1}(\\sin(6x)) = 6x - 360$ . As $72$ is not on the interval $45 \\leq x \\leq 60$ , this yields no solution. For $60 \\leq x \\leq 75$ , $6x$ is in the first quadrant plus a full revolution. Thus, $\\sin^{-1}(\\sin(6x)) = 6x - 360$ . This yields the solution $x = 72$ . For $75 \\leq x \\leq 90$ , $6x$ is in the second quadrant plus a full revolution. Thus $\\sin^{-1}(\\sin(6x)) = 540 - 6x$ . This yields the solution $x = \\frac{540}7$ . There are $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }4}$ solutions, $x=0$ , $x=\\pi/7$ , $x=2\\pi/5$ , and $x=3\\pi/7$ . Algebraically, the inverse function of a function should just cancel out, leaving $6x=x$ . However, upon inspection we find that the graphs of these \"inverse function of the function\" equations are also periodic, like their normal trig function counterparts, due to the fact that inverse trig functions will never return any angle value higher than $2\\pi$ . But instead of a smooth wave, these graphs are made up of zigzags with slope $1$ and $-1$ . Trying a few values, we see that  $y = \\arcsin{\\sin{x}}$  peaks at $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ and  $y = \\arccos{\\cos{x}}$  peaks at $\\pi$  But we want the graph of $y = \\arcsin{(\\sin6{x})}$ , which has a period of $\\frac{\\pi}{3}$ instead of $2\\pi$ . So this means the interval $[0, \\pi]$ will show $3$ periods instead of $\\frac{1}{2}$ of a period. Visually it would be lines with slopes $6$ and $-6$ . Using the graph paper given to us, we plot out the two equations according to the above and we see that they intersect $4$ times $\\Rightarrow \\boxed{\\text{B}}$ . The most conventional domain and range for $\\cos^{-1} x$ is $x \\in [-1, 1]$ and $\\cos^{-1} x \\in [0, \\pi]$ . For $\\cos x$ , $x \\in [0, \\pi]$ and $\\cos x \\in [-1, 1]$ . Since the domain of $\\cos x$ is equal to the range of $\\cos^{-1} x$ , and the range of $\\cos x$ is equal to the domain of $\\cos^{-1} x$ , $\\cos^{-1} (\\cos x) = x$ . Meaning that $\\sin^{ - 1}(\\sin 6x) = x$ , $\\sin x = \\sin (6x)$ . By graphing $\\sin x$ and $\\sin 6x$ together, it can be seen that there are 7 intersections for $x \\in [0, \\pi]$ . 2009AMC12BP24.png However, the range of $\\sin^{-1} x$ is $[-\\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\frac{\\pi}{2}]$ . Therefore $x \\in [0, \\frac{\\pi}{2}]$ for $x = \\sin^{ - 1}(\\sin 6x)$ . There are $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }4}$ solutions for $x \\in [0, \\frac{\\pi}{2}]$ . The $4$ solutions are respectively: $x = 6x$ , $x = 0$  $x + 2 \\pi = 6x$ , $x = \\frac25 \\pi$  $\\pi - x = 6x$ , $x = \\frac{\\pi}{7}$  $3 \\pi - x = 6x$ , $x = \\frac37 \\pi$  ~ isabelchen \n",

Assume that we picked the blue square, how many different red squares do share it? Answering this question is not as simple as it may seem. Consider the picture below. It shows all three red squares that share the same blue square. In addition, the picture shows a green square that is not valid, as two of its vertices are in bad locations.

Consider any square $ABCD$ where all four vertices are in $G$ , and the side length is at least $6$ , so the four vertices must lie in distinct quadrants (Same proof as in solution 1). Without loss of generality, assume that $A,B,C,D$ are in the first, second, third, fourth quadrant. Then we consider the following mapping: \\[A \\to A' = A\\]  \\[B \\to B' = B + (10,0)\\]  \\[C \\to C' = C + (10,10)\\]  \\[D \\to D' = D + (0,10)\\]  Then the new points $A'$ , $B'$ , $C'$ , $D'$ are either being the same point or forming a square in $G_1 = G \\cap \\{ x>0, y>0 \\}$ , a 5x5 grid. Conversely, for any point in $G_1$ , it can be reversed to a square $ABCD$ ; however, for any square in $G_1$ , there are four possible squares $ABCD$ that were mapped to them. Therefore the number of possible squares $ABCD$ is equal to $25 + 4N$ , where $N$ is the number of squares inscribed in $G_1$ . Moreover by the same idea in solution 1, each square (with sides parallel or slanted to the axes) in a $G_1$ can be inscribed in a square in $G_1$ , with sides parallel to one of the axes, call it \"standard square\". Noticing that each standard square of side length $a$ corresponds to $a$ inscribed squares,  and that there are $(5-a)^2$ number of standard squares of side length $a$ , we have \\[N = \\sum_{a=1}^{4} a(5-a)^2 = 1\\cdot 16 + 2\\cdot 9 + 3 \\cdot 4 + 4 \\cdot 1 = 16+18+12+4=50\\]  So the answer is $25+4\\cdot 50 = 225$  Motivation(by williamgolly, solution by MAA):\n",
      "Homotheties Start with Solution 2: the number of possible squares $ABCD$ is equal to $25 + 4N$ . Notice there are only 2 options ( $A$ , and $E$ ) which have integer solutions for N. Option $A$ corresponds to $N=25$ , and option $E$ corresponds to $N=50$ . At this point, guessing between the 2 choices is already worth it, but there are already 16 unit squares (solutions to N), meaning that the answer is more probably $E$ . Edit:There are 125 squares you can make w/out tilted ones, so the answer is more than 125, hence $E$ . Consider any square that meets the requirements described in the problem. Then, take the vertices of the square and translate them to the first quadrant (This is the \"mapping\" described in Solution 2). For example, consider a square with vertices $(7, 7), (-7, 7), (-7, -7),$ and $(7, -7)$ :  [asy] defaultpen(black+0.75bp+fontsize(8pt)); size(5cm); path p = scale(.15)*unitcircle; draw((-8,0)--(8.5,0),Arrow(HookHead,1mm)); draw((0,-8)--(0,8.5),Arrow(HookHead,1mm)); int i,j; for (i=-7;i<8;++i) { for (j=-7;j<8;++j) { if (((-7 <= i) && (i <= -3)) || ((3 <= i) &&  (i<= 7))) { if (((-7 <= j) && (j <= -3)) || ((3 <= j) &&  (j<= 7))) { fill(shift(i,j)*p,black); }}}} draw((-7,-.2)--(-7,.2),black+0.5bp); draw((-3,-.2)--(-3,.2),black+0.5bp); draw((3,-.2)--(3,.2),black+0.5bp); draw((7,-.2)--(7,.2),black+0.5bp); draw((-.2,-7)--(.2,-7),black+0.5bp); draw((-.2,-3)--(.2,-3),black+0.5bp); draw((-.2,3)--(.2,3),black+0.5bp); draw((-.2,7)--(.2,7),black+0.5bp); label(\"$-7$\",(-7,0),S); label(\"$-3$\",(-3,0),S); label(\"$3$\",(3,0),S); label(\"$7$\",(7,0),S); label(\"$-7$\",(0,-7),W); label(\"$-3$\",(0,-3),W); label(\"$3$\",(0,3),W); label(\"$7$\",(0,7),W); draw( (7,7) -- (-7,7) -- (-7,-7) -- (7,-7) -- cycle, black ); [/asy]  After following the mapping described in Solution 2, the square looks like this:  [asy] defaultpen(black+0.75bp+fontsize(8pt)); size(5cm); path p = scale(.15)*unitcircle; draw((-8,0)--(8.5,0),Arrow(HookHead,1mm)); draw((0,-8)--(0,8.5),Arrow(HookHead,1mm)); int i,j; for (i=-7;i<8;++i) { for (j=-7;j<8;++j) { if (((-7 <= i) && (i <= -3)) || ((3 <= i) &&  (i<= 7))) { if (((-7 <= j) && (j <= -3)) || ((3 <= j) &&  (j<= 7))) { fill(shift(i,j)*p,black); }}}} draw((-7,-.2)--(-7,.2),black+0.5bp); draw((-3,-.2)--(-3,.2),black+0.5bp); draw((3,-.2)--(3,.2),black+0.5bp); draw((7,-.2)--(7,.2),black+0.5bp); draw((-.2,-7)--(.2,-7),black+0.5bp); draw((-.2,-3)--(.2,-3),black+0.5bp); draw((-.2,3)--(.2,3),black+0.5bp); draw((-.2,7)--(.2,7),black+0.5bp); label(\"$-7$\",(-7,0),S); label(\"$-3$\",(-3,0),S); label(\"$3$\",(3,0),S); label(\"$7$\",(7,0),S); label(\"$-7$\",(0,-7),W); label(\"$-3$\",(0,-3),W); label(\"$3$\",(0,3),W); label(\"$7$\",(0,7),W); draw( (3,3) -- (3,7) -- (7,7) -- (7,3) -- cycle, black ); [/asy]  The position of each vertex within their corresponding grid has not changed.For example, the point $(-7, 7)$ is still the top-left point in a grid, albeit a change in quadrant. Trying this out with a couple of other squares, we see that the following property holds: \\[\\text{\"For any and all squares with vertices in each of the four quadrants, the 'mapped' version is also a square.\"}\\]  Therefore the logical inverse is true:  \\[\\text{\"For any 'mapped' square with all four vertices in the first quadrant,}\\]  \\[\\text{there exists at least one corresponding 'unmapped' square with a vertex in each of the four quadrants.\"}\\]  But how many \"unmapped\" squares, to be exact? This might seem complicated at first, but with some intuitive thinking, we realize that there are exactly $4$ \"unmapped\" squares that correspond with a \"mapped\" square. This is because given a \"mapped\" square, there are $4$ choices for the vertex that will remain in the first quadrant; but once that point is chosen, there is only $1$ distribution of the other $3$ vertices that will result in a square. So, we want four times the number of squares we can make in the first quadrant grid. We divide our counting method into two cases: squares with side length $0$ after mapping (which means all four vertices are in the same position relative to their own grids) and squares with side length $1-4$ after mapping. Case 1: There are $25$ such squares of length $0$ (this is equivalent to counting the number of points on the grid). However, in this scenario, all of the vertices have been mapped onto the same point. So instead of $4$ choices for the first quadrant vertex, there is only one. Subsequently there are  only $25$ such squares that correspond to them. Case 2: Let a square with sides parallel to the axes be known as $A$ squares. These $A$ squares can have side length $1, 2, 3,$ or $4$ . However, the number of $A$ squares possible depends on the side length. For example, there is only $1$ possible $A$ square of side length $4$ , but $16$ squares of side length $1$ . To be exact, there are $(5-s)^2$ possible $A$ squares of side length $s$ . So, the total number of $A$ squares is  $\\sum_{s=1}^4 (5-s)^2$  But what about \"tilted\" squares? Notice that \"tilted squares\" can always be inscribed (drawn within) another, bigger square. Let a square inscribed within an $A$ square be called a $B$ square. How many $B$ squares are there? Well, this also depends on the side length. We only want squares whose vertices are lattice points (integer value coordinates), so the number of $B$ squares should increase along with side length. We defined $B$ squares to be inscribed within $A$ squares, so we can say that all $B$ squares have their vertices on the side on an $A$ square. Consider an $A$ square with side length $4$ . There are $3$ other lattice points along the side of the $A$ square, not counting the vertices. Therefore, we can say that there are $s-1$ possible $B$ squares for every $A$ square with side length $s$ . We can multiply $(s-1)$ times the number of $A$ squares to get the number of $B$ squares. This is  $\\sum_{s=1}^4 (s-1)(5-s)^2$  total $B$ squares. But we need to add these two quantities to get the number of squares for Case 2:  $\\sum_{s=1}^4 (s-1)(5-s)^2 + \\sum_{s=1}^4 (5-s)^2$  By distributive property, the expression becomes  $\\sum_{s=1}^4 s(5-s)^2$  Solving, we get $50$ \"mapped\" squares, both $A$ and $B$ . Multiplying this by $4$ to get the corresponding number of \"unmapped\" squares, then adding to get the number of squares for Case 1, we get  $50*4 + 25 = 225 \\Rightarrow \\boxed{\\text{E}}$ .\n",

      " Start with Brian. If he is a toad, he tells the truth, hence Mike is a frog. If Brian is a frog, he lies, hence Mike is a frog, too. Thus Mike must be a frog. As Mike is a frog, his statement is false, hence there is at most one toad. As there is at most one toad, at least one of Chris and LeRoy is a frog. But then the other one tells the truth, and therefore is a toad. Hence we must have one toad and $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D)}\\ 3}$ frogs.  Notice that one of Chris and LeRoy must be a frog: if Chris is a frog, then he lies about LeRoy being a frog. Hence LeRoy is a toad. Alternatively, if Chris is a toad, then he tells the truth about LeRoy being a frog. Assume Brian is a toad. Then Mike is a frog, and he lies about at least two being toads. This means that none or one of the amphibians is a toad (the opposite of the statement $n\\geq2$ is $n<2$ , or $n=0, 1$ ). However, this is absurd because we assumed Brian is a toad, and we know one of Chris and LeRoy is a toad. So our assumption leads to a contradiction.

      " The image below shows the two curves for $k=4$ . The blue curve is $x^2+y^2=k^2$ , which is clearly a circle with radius $k$ , and the red curve is a part of the curve $xy=k$ . [asy] import graph; size(200);  real f(real x) {return 4/x;}; real g1(real x) {return sqrt(4*4-x*x);}; real g2(real x) {return -sqrt(4*4-x*x);}; draw(graph(f,-20./3,-0.6),red); draw(graph(f,0.6,20./3),red); draw(graph(g1,-4,4),blue); draw(graph(g2,-4,4),blue); axes(\"$x$\",\"$y$\"); [/asy]  In the special case $k=0$ the blue curve is just the point $(0,0)$ , and as $0\\cdot 0=0$ , this point is on the red curve as well, hence they intersect. The case $k<0$ is symmetric to $k>0$ : the blue curve remains the same and the red curve is flipped according to the $x$ axis. Hence we just need to focus on $k>0$ . Clearly, on the red curve there will always be points arbitrarily far from the origin: for example, as $x$ approaches 0, $y$ approaches $\\infty$ . Hence the red curve intersects the blue one if and only if it contains a point whose distance from the origin is at most $k$ . At this point we can guess that on the red curve the point where $x=y$ is always closest to the origin, and skip the rest of this solution. For an exact solution, fix $k$ and consider any point $(x,y)$ on the red curve. Its distance from the origin is $\\sqrt{ x^2 + (k/x)^2 }$ . To minimize this distance, it is enough to minimize $x^2 + (k/x)^2$ . By the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean Inequality we get that this value is at least $2k$ , and that equality holds whenever $x^2 = (k/x)^2$ , i.e., $x=\\pm\\sqrt k$ . Now recall that the red curve intersects the blue one if and only if its closest point is at most $k$ from the origin. We just computed that the distance between the origin and the closest point on the red curve is $\\sqrt{2k}$ . Therefore, we want to find all positive integers $k$ such that $\\sqrt{2k} > k$ . Clearly the only such integer is $k=1$ , hence the two curves are only disjoint for $k=1$ and $k=-1$ . \n",
      "This is a total of $\\boxed{2\\ \\textbf{(C)}}$ values. From the graph shown above, we see that there is a specific point closest to the center of the circle. Using some logic, we realize that as long as said furthest point is not inside or on the graph of the circle. This should be enough to conclude that the hyperbola does not intersect the circle. Therefore, for each value of k, we only need to check said value to determine intersection. Let said point, closest to the circle have coordinates $(x, k/x)$ derived from the equation. Then, all coordinates that satisfy $\\sqrt{ x^2+ (k/x)^2 } \\leq k$ intersect the circle.\n",
      "Squaring, we find $x^2+(k/x)^2 \\leq k^2.$ After multiplying through by $x^2$ and rearranging, we find $x^4-x^2k^2+k^2 \\leq 0$ .\n",
      "We see this is a quadratic in $x^2$ and consider taking the determinant, which tells us that solutions are real when, after factoring: $k^2(k^2-4) \\geq 0$ We plot this inequality on the number line to find it is satisfied for all values except: $(-1, 0, 1)$ .\n",
      "We then eliminate 0 because it is extraneous as both $xy=0$ and $x^2+y^2=0$ are points which coincide.\n",
      "Therefore, there are a total of $\\boxed{2\\ \\textbf{(C)}}$ values. Since $xy=k$ , multiply the equation by 2 on both sides to get $2xy=2k$ . Now we can add the two equations to get $(x+y)^2=k^2+2k$ , for which the only value of $k$ that does not satisfy the equation is $-1$ , as that makes the RHS negative. Similarly, if we subtract the two equations, we obtain $(x-y)^2=k^2-2k$ , for which the only value of $k$ that does not satisfy the equation is $1$ , for the same reason above. Thus, the only values are $k = 1, -1$ , giving us a total of $\\boxed{2\\ \\textbf{(C)}}$ values. ~ ccx09 (Roy Short) Multiply $k=xy$ by and substitute it into $k^2=x^2+y^2$ . Then, $k=\\frac{x^2+y^2}{xy}$ . Recognize it? It's also $k=\\frac{x}{y}+\\frac{y}{x}$ . The minimum of this function (more accurately the minimum absolute value of the function) is k=2, -2 (when x=y or x=-y). As long as k>2 or k<-2, the function is valid. As such, $k\\neq1,-1 \\implies \\boxed{2\\ \\textbf{(C)}}$ . Elegant, huh? ~~BJHHar Assume that $k\\ge 0$ since if $k$ works then $-k$ also works. Let $x = ka$ and $y = kb$ . Then the given equations become $ab = \\frac{1}{k}$ and $a^2 + b^2 = 1$ , which we don't want to intersect. The points that are the closest on this graph are $(1/\\sqrt{2}, 1/\\sqrt{2})$ and $(1/\\sqrt{k})(1/\\sqrt{k})$ . We don't want the hyperbola to intersect or go inside the circle, so we require $1/\\sqrt{k} > 1/\\sqrt{2}$ , so $k< 2\\implies k = 0, 1$ . Also, by symmetry $k = -1$ also works.Obviously $k = 0$ doesn't work, so we can discard that, leaving $\\boxed{\\mathbf{(C)}\\quad 2}$ integral solutions for $k$  To know when the system does not intersect, we first need to find when they do intersect. To do so, we substitute $xy=k$ into $x^{2}+y^{2}=k^{2}$ giving: $x^2+y^2=(xy)^2$  By Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick, we get $1=(1-x)(1+x)(1-y)(1+y)$  Notice that other than for $x$ and/or $y$ equal to $-1$ and/or $1$ because for any $x$ or $y$ we can get some coordinates that work even if they're fractions which through $xy=k$ it can become an integer as $\\dfrac{1}{2}\\times2=1$  This means we have to exclude $xy=k=1$ or $-1$ . This is $\\boxed{2}$ values that do not work. ~Batmanstark The first equation is describing a circle with radius $k$ centered at $(0,0)$ , so we can rewrite it in terms of a new variable $\\theta$ : \\[(k\\cos(\\theta))^2+(k\\sin(\\theta))^2=k^2.\\]  A quick check shows that this identity holds since $\\sin^2+\\cos^2=1$ . Now, with an alternate expression for $x$ and $y$ , we can plug this into the second equation to get: \\[(k\\sin(\\theta))(k\\cos(\\theta))=k\\rightarrow k^2\\sin(\\theta)\\cos(\\theta)=k.\\]  Since the two equations does intersect when $k=0$ at $(x,y)=(0,0)$ , we do not need to consider the $k=0$ case, so we can safely divide both sides by $k^2$ to get: \\[\\sin(\\theta)\\cos(\\theta)=\\frac{1}{k}.\\]  We can see that the intersections of these two equations will remain unchanged, only now that the solutions will be in terms of $k$ and $\\theta$ . Because the range of both $\\sin$ and $\\cos$ are limited to $[0,1]$ , the range of $\\sin(\\theta)\\cos(\\theta)$ will not exceed $1$ . However, the only way that the product could equal 1 is if both $\\sin(\\theta)$ and $\\cos(\\theta)$ to equal 1 at the same time, so since the maxima of the functions don't match up, this is an impossible case. Therefore, this equation will only have valid solutions when $k>1$ , not at $k=1$ . A quick sanity check with $\\theta=\\frac{\\pi}{4}$ shows that $\\frac{1}{k}=\\frac{1}{2}$ and all values less than $\\frac{1}{2}$ is indeed contained in the range. For all $k<0$ , symmetry about the $y$ -axis will give an identical argument with the equation $\\sin(\\theta)\\cos(\\theta)=-\\frac{1}{k}$ , with $k<-1$ producing valid solutions for our system. Then, the only two values of $k$ such that the system of equations won't intersect are $1$ and $-1$ , a total of $\\boxed{2}$ values. (Note: In the graph of $f(x)=\\sin(x)\\cos(x)$ , the range of the function is actually even more restricted, being $\\left[-\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2}\\right]$ . However, in a contest, observing that the value of $|\\sin(x)\\cos(x)|<1$ would suffice since the question is only asking for integer values of $k$ .) ~chz3369 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YwShc-9n-4     2010 AMC 12A ( Problems • Answer Key • Resources )   Preceded by Problem 12   Followed by Problem 14    1  •  2  •  3  •  4  •  5  •  6  •  7  •  8  •  9  •  10  •  11  •  12  •  13  •  14  •  15  •  16  •  17  •  18  •  19  •  20  •  21  •  22  •  23  •  24  •  25    All AMC 12 Problems and Solutions  The problems on this page are copyrighted by the Mathematical Association of America 's American Mathematics Competitions .

If Bernardo does not pick $9$ , then he can pick any number from $1$ to $8$ . Since Bernardo is picking from the same set of numbers as Silvia, the probability that Bernardo's number is larger is equal to the probability that Silvia's number is larger. Ignoring the $9$ for now, the probability that they will pick the same number is the number of ways to pick Bernardo's 3 numbers divided by the number of ways to pick any 3 numbers.

This actually undercounts. Note that picking $3,7,6$ will lead to the same end result as picking $7,3,6$ (order does not matter, since it will be descending no matter what).

From Silvia's set, there are $\\binom{8}{3} = 56$ numbers that she can randomly choose. Since Bernardo and Silvia can choose their numbers independently, there are $84 \\cdot 56$ pairs of numbers that you can compare. For example, if Bernardo chooses 321 and Silvia chooses 543, that is one pair. We can sort Bernardo's numbers from the greatest to the smallest. We can do the same for Silvia's numbers. So, Bernardo's greatest $84 - 56 = 28$ numbers are all bigger than Silvia's numbers. Here, we have $28 \\cdot 56$ pairs satisfying that Bernardo's number will be greater than Silvia's. If Bernardo chooses the 29th greatest number, which is the same as Silvia's greatest number, hence there will be $56 - 1 = 55$ pairs satisfying that Bernardo's 29th greatest number will be greater than Silvia's. Similarly, if Bernardo chooses the 30th greatest number, there will be $55 - 1 = 54$ pairs satisfying that Bernardo's 30th greatest number will be greater than Silvia's. This pattern continues. So if Bernardo chooses the 29th greatest number or below, he will have $55 + 54 + 53 + \\cdots + 1$ pairs where his number will be greater than Silvia's. In total, Bernardo's probability of having a greater number than Silvia's is $\\frac{28 \\cdot 56 + (55 + 54 + 53 + \\cdots + 1)}{84 \\cdot 56} = \\frac{37}{56}$ , which is $\\textbf{(B)}$ . - Leo M.

      " It is clear that $\\triangle ACE$ is an equilateral triangle. From the Law of Cosines on $\\triangle ABC$ , we get that $AC^2 = r^2+1^2-2r\\cos{\\frac{2\\pi}{3}} = r^2+r+1$ . Therefore, the area of $\\triangle ACE$ is $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}(r^2+r+1)$ by area of an equilateral triangle. If we extend $BC$ , $DE$ and $FA$ so that $FA$ and $BC$ meet at $X$ , $BC$ and $DE$ meet at $Y$ , and $DE$ and $FA$ meet at $Z$ , we find that hexagon $ABCDEF$ is formed by taking equilateral triangle $XYZ$ of side length $r+2$ and removing three equilateral triangles, $ABX$ , $CDY$ and $EFZ$ , of side length $1$ . The area of $ABCDEF$ is therefore $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}(r+2)^2-\\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{4} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}(r^2+4r+1)$ . Based on the initial conditions, \\[\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}(r^2+r+1) = \\frac{7}{10}\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}\\right)(r^2+4r+1)\\]  Simplifying this gives us $r^2-6r+1 = 0$ . By Vieta's Formulas we know that the sum of the possible value of $r$ is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E)}\\ 6}$ . Step 1: Use Law of Cosines in the same manner as the previous solution to get $AC=\\sqrt{r^2+r+1}$ . Step 2: $\\triangle{ABC}$ ~ $\\triangle{CDE}$ ~ $\\triangle{EFA}$ via SAS congruency. Using the formula $[ABC]=\\frac{ab \\sin C}{2}= \\frac{r \\sqrt{3}}{4}$ . The area of the hexagon is equal to $[ACE] + 3[ABC]$ . We are given that $70\\%$ of this area is equal to $[ACE]$ ; solving for $AC$ in terms of $r$ gives $AC=\\sqrt{7r}$ . Step 3: $\\sqrt{7r}=\\sqrt{r^2+r+1} \\implies r^2-6r+1=0$ and by Vieta's Formulas , we get $\\boxed{\\textbf{E}}$ . Note: To verify that the quadratic $r^2-6r+1$ has two positive roots, we can either solve for the roots directly or note that discriminant is positive, and there are no negative roots (because then $r^2, -6r, 1$ would all be positive). Find the area of the triangle $ACE$ as how it was done in solution 1. Find the sum of the areas of the congruent  triangles $ABC, CDE, EFA$ as how it was done in solution 2. The sum of these areas is the area of the hexagon, hence the areas of the congruent  triangles $ABC, CDE, EFA$ is $30\\%$ of the area of the hexagon. Hence $\\frac{7}{3}$ times the latter is equal to the triangle $ACE$ . Hence $\\frac{7}{3}\\cdot\\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{4}r=\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}(r^2+r+1)$ . We can simplify this to $7r=r^2+r+1\\implies r^2-6r+1=0$ . By Vieta's, we get the sum of all possible values of $r$ is $-\\frac{-6}{1}=6\\text{ or } \\boxed{\\textbf{E}}$ .\n",
      "-vsamc Proof Triangle ACE is Equilateral. We know $\\triangle{ABC}$ , $\\triangle{CDE}$ , and $\\triangle{EFA}$ are congruent by SAS, so the side opposite the 120 degree angle is also the same (since the triangles are congruent). Thus $\\triangle{ACE}$ is equilateral.\n",

There is symmetry about $y=x$ , so we only have to consider $(1,-1), (1,0)$ , and $(1,1)$ . $(1,1)$ can go on the boundary in two ways, so we can only consider one case and multiply it by two. For $(1,0)$ and $(1,-1)$ we can just multiply by two. So we count paths from $(-4,4)$ to each of these points, and then multiply that by the number of ways to get from the point one unit right of that to $(4,4)$ , and all in all, we get the answer is $\\dbinom{16}{8}-2\\left[\\dbinom{8}{3}\\dbinom{7}{2}+\\dbinom{9}{4}\\dbinom{6}{2}+\\dbinom{10}{5}\\dbinom{5}{2}\\right]=1698$ , which is answer choice $\\textbf{(D)}$ -vsamc\n",
      "Note: Sorry if this was rushed. As stated in the solution, there are $6$ points along the line $y=-x$ that constitute a sort of \"boundary\". Once the ant reaches one of these $6$ points, it is exactly halfway to $(4, 4)$ . Also notice that the ant will only cross one of the $6$ points during any one of its paths. Therefore we can divide the problem into $3$ cases, focusing on $1$ quadrant; then multiplying the sum by $2$ to get the total (because there is symmetry). For the sake of this explanation, we will focus on the fourth quadrant (it really doesn't matter which quadrant because, again the layout is symmetrical) The three cases are when the ant crosses $(4, -4), (3, -3),$ and $(2, -2)$ . For each of the cases, notice that the path the ant takes can be expressed as a sequence of steps, such as: right, right, up, right,..., etc. Also notice that there are always $8$ steps per sequence (if there were more or less steps, the ant would be breaking the conditions given in the problem). This means we can figure out the number of ways to get to a point based on the particular sequence of steps that denote each path. For example, there is only one way for the ant to pass through $(4, -4);$ it MUST keep traveling right for all $8$ steps. This seems fairly obvious; however, notice that this is equivalent to  $\\binom{8}{0}$  Now we consider the number of ways to get from $(4, -4)$ to $(4, 4)$ . by symmetry, there is only $1$ such way. So the number of paths containing $(4, -4)$ is $1^2,$ or $1$ . Moving on to the next case, we see that the ant MUST travel right exactly $7$ times and up exactly once. So each sequence of this type will have $7$ \"right\"s and $1$ \"up\". So, the total number of paths that go through $(3, -3)$ is equivalent to the number of ways to arrange $1$ \"up\" into $8$ spots. This is  $\\binom{8}{1} = 8$  Similarly to the first case, we square this value to account for the second half of the journey: $8^2 = 64$ . Finally, for the third case (ant passes through $(2, -2)$ ) the ant must travel right exactly $6$ times and up exactly $2$ times. This is equivalent to the number of ways to arrange $2$ \"ups\" in a sequence of $8$ movements, or  $\\binom{8}{2} = 28$  Again, we square $28$ : $28^2 = 784$ . Adding up all of these cases we get  $1+64+784 = 849$  paths through the fourth quadrant. Doubling this number to account for the paths through the second quadrant, we have  $849*2=1698 \\Rightarrow \\boxed{\\text{D}}$ .

      " Solution 1 Since $\\left(a_n\\right)$ and $\\left(b_n\\right)$ have integer terms with $a_1=b_1=1$ , we can write the terms of each sequence as \\begin{align*}&\\left(a_n\\right) \\Rightarrow \\{1, x+1, 2x+1, 3x+1, ...\\}\\\\ &\\left(b_n\\right) \\Rightarrow \\{1, y+1, 2y+1, 3y+1, ...\\}\\end{align*}  where $x$ and $y$ ( $x\\leq y$ ) are the common differences of each, respectively. Since \\begin{align*}a_n &= (n-1)x+1\\\\ b_n &= (n-1)y+1\\end{align*}  it is easy to see that $a_n \\equiv b_n \\equiv 1 \\mod{(n-1)}$ . Hence, we have to find the largest $n$ such that $\\frac{a_n-1}{n-1}$ and $\\frac{b_n-1}{n-1}$ are both integers; equivalently, we want to maximize $\\gcd(a_n-1, b_n-1)$ . The prime factorization of $2010$ is $2\\cdot{3}\\cdot{5}\\cdot{67}$ . We list out all the possible pairs that have a product of $2010$ , noting that these are the possible values of $(a_n, b_n)$ and we need $a_n \\leq b_n$ : \\[(2,1005), (3, 670), (5,402), (6,335), (10,201),(15,134),(30,67)\\]  and soon find that the largest $n-1$ value is $7$ for the pair $(15, 134)$ , and so the largest $n$ value is $\\boxed{8\\ \\textbf{(C)}}$ . Solution 2 As above, let $a_n=(n-1)x+1$ and $b_n=(n-1)y+1$ for some $1\\leq x\\leq y$ . Now we get $2010 = a_n b_n = (n-1)^2xy + (n-1)(x+y) + 1$ , hence $2009 = (n-1)( (n-1)xy + x + y )$ . Therefore $n-1$ divides $2009 = 7^2 \\cdot 41$ . And as the second term is greater than the first one, we only have to consider the options $n-1\\in\\{1,7,41\\}$ . For $n=42$ we easily see that for $x=y=1$ the right side is less than $49$ and for any other $(x,y)$ it is way too large. For $n=8$ we are looking for $(x,y)$ such that $7xy + x + y = 2009/7 = 7\\cdot 41$ . Note that $x+y$ must be divisible by $7$ . We can start looking for the solution by trying the possible values for $x+y$ , and we easily discover that for $x+y=21$ we get $xy + 3 = 41$ , which has a suitable solution $(x,y)=(2,19)$ . Hence $n=8$ is the largest possible $n$ . (There is no need to check $n=2$ anymore.) Since  $a_n*b_n = 2010,$  and  $a_n \\le b_n$ ,\n",
      "blue+yellow=green it follows that  $a_n \\le \\sqrt{2010} \\Rightarrow a_n \\le 44$ . But $a_n$ and $b_n$ are also integers, so $a_n$ must be a factor of $2010$ smaller than $44$ . Notice that $2010 = 2*3*5*67$ . Therefore $a_n = 2, 3, 5, 6, 112, 15,$ or $30$ and $b_n = 1005, 670, 402, 335, 201, 134,$ or $67$ ; respectively. Notice that the term $a_m$ is equivalent to the first term $a_1 = 1$ plus $(m-1)$ times the common difference for that particular arithmetic sequence. Let the common difference of $(a_n)$ be $k$ and the common difference of $(b_n)$ be $i$ (not $\\sqrt{-1}$ ). Then  $a_n$ (the $n$ th term, not the sequence itself) $=1 + k(n-1)$  and  $b_n = 1 + i(n-1)$  Subtracting one from all the possible values listed above for $a_n$ and $b_n$ , we get  $k(n-1) = 1, 2, 4, 5, 9, 14, 29$  and  $i(n-1) = 1004, 669, 401, 334, 200, 133, 66$  In order to maximize $n$ , we must maximize $n-1$ . Therefore $k$ and $i$ are coprime and $n-1$ is the GCF of any corresponding pair. Inspecting all of the pairs, we see that the GCF is always $1$ except for the pair $(14, 133),$ which has a GCF of $7$ .

So, $k^2x^6+2klx^5+(2km+l^2)x^4+2(kn+lm)x^3+ax^2-bx-c = 0$  By matching the coefficients of the first $4$ terms, we have $k^2 = 1, 2kl = -10, 2km+l^2 = 29, 2kn+2lm = -4$  Solving the equations above, we have $2$ sets of solutions; first set of which is $k = 1, l = -5, m = 2, n = 8$ . Second set of which is $k = -1, l = 5, m = -2, n = -8$ . After squaring both sets, they are the same i.e. $x^3-5x^2+2x+8 = 0$ . This is equal to $(x-4)(x-2)(x+1) = 0$ .

      " If we graph each term separately, we will notice that all of the zeros occur at $\\frac{1}{m}$ , where $m$ is any integer from $1$ to $119$ , inclusive: $|mx-1|=0\\implies mx=1\\implies x=\\frac{1}{m}$ . The minimum value of $f(x)$ occurs where the absolute value of the sum of the slopes is at a minimum $\\ge 0$ , since it is easy to see that the value will be increasing on either side. That means the minimum must happen at some $\\frac{1}{m}$ . The sum of the slopes at $x = \\frac{1}{m}$ is \\begin{align*}&\\sum_{i=m+1}^{119}i - \\sum_{i=1}^{m}i\\\\ &=\\sum_{i=1}^{119}i - 2\\sum_{i=1}^{m}i\\\\ &=-m^2-m+7140\\end{align*}  Now we want to minimize $-m^2-m+7140$ . The zeros occur at $-85$ and $84$ , which means the slope is $0$ where $m = 84, 85$ . We can now verify that both $x=\\frac{1}{84}$ and $x=\\frac{1}{85}$ yield $\\boxed{49\\ \\textbf{(A)}}$ . You can also think of the slopes playing 'tug of war', where the slope of each absolute function upon passing its $x$ -intercept is negated, positively tugging on the remaining negative slopes. The sum of the slopes is $1+2+3+4\\dots 119=\\sum_{m=1}^{119}m=\\frac{119\\cdot 120}{2}=60\\cdot 119=7140$  So we need to find the least integer $a$ such that $1+2+3+\\dots a=\\sum_{n=1}^an=\\frac{a(a+1)}{2}\\ge \\frac{7140}{2}=3570:$  \\[a(a+1)\\ge 7140\\implies a^2+a-7140\\ge 0\\rightarrow a=84\\text{ exactly!}\\] This \"exactly\" means that the slope is ZERO between the whole interval $x\\in\\left(\\frac{1}{85},\\frac{1}{84}\\right)$ . We can explicitly evaluate both to check that they are both equal to the desired minimum value of $f(x)$ : \\[\\frac{84+83+\\dots+2+1+1+2+\\dots+33+34}{85}=\\frac{84(85)/2+34(35)/2}{85}=\\frac{85(14+84)/2}{85}=49\\]  \\[\\frac{83+82+\\dots+2+1+1+2+\\dots+34+35}{84}=\\frac{83(84)/2+35(36)/2}{84}=\\frac{84(15+83)/2}{84}=49\\]  Thus the minimum value of $f(x)$ is $49$ . Rewrite the given expression as follows: \\[1|x-1| + 2\\left|x-\\frac 12\\right| + \\cdots + 119\\left|x-\\frac 1{119}\\right|\\] Imagine the real line. For each $n\\in\\{1,\\dots,119\\}$ imagine that there are $n$ boys standing at the coordinate $\\frac 1n$ . We now need to place a donut on the real line in such a way that the sum of its distances from all the boys is minimal, and we need to compute this sum. Note that there are $B=1+2+\\cdots+119 = 119\\cdot 60=7140$ boys in total. Let's label them from 1 (the only boy placed at $1$ ) to $B$ (the last boy placed at $\\frac 1{119}$ . Clearly, the minimum sum is achieved if the donut's coordinate is the median of the boys' coordinates. To prove this, place the donut at the median coordinate. If you now move it in any direction by any amount $d$ , there will be $B/2$ boys such that it moves $d$ away from this boy. For each of the remaining boys, it moves at most $d$ closer, hence the total sum of distances does not decrease. Hence the optimal solution is to place the donut at the median coordinate. Or, more precisely, as $B$ is even, we can place it anywhere on the segment formed by boy $B/2$ and boy $(B/2)+1$ : by extending the previous argument, anywhere on this segment the sum of distances is the same. By trial and error, or by solving the quadratic equation $z(z+1)/2 = 7140/2$ we get that boy number $B/2$ is the last boy placed at $\\frac 1{84}$ and the next boy is the one placed at $\\frac 1{85}$ . Hence the given expression is minimized for any $x\\in\\left[ \\frac 1{85}, \\frac 1{84} \\right]$ . Common part of both solutions To find the minimum, we want to balance the expression so that it is neither top nor bottom heavy. $\\frac{119(120)}{2(2)}=\\frac{7140}{2}=3570=\\frac{84(85)}{2}=\\frac{119(120)}{2}-\\frac{84(85)}{2}$ . Now that we know that the sum of the first 84 $x$ 's is equivalent to the sum of $x$ 's 85 to 119, we can plug either $\\frac{1}{84}$ or $\\frac{1}{85}$ to find the minimum. Note that the terms $x-1$ to $83x-1$ are negative, and the terms $85x-1$ to $119x-1$ are positive. Hence we get: \\begin{align*} & |x-1| + |2x-1| + \\cdots + |83x-1| \\\\ =~ & (1-x) + (1-2x) + \\cdots + (1-83x) \\\\ =~ & 83 - x(1+2+\\cdots+83) \\\\ =~ & 83 - \\frac 1{84} \\cdot \\frac{83\\cdot 84}2 \\\\ =~ & 83 - \\frac{83}2 \\\\ =~ & \\frac{83}2 \\end{align*} and \\begin{align*} & |85x-1| + |86x-1| + \\cdots + |119x-1| \\\\ =~ & (85x-1) + (86x-1) + \\cdots + (119x-1) \\\\ =~ & x(85+86+\\cdots+119) - (119-84) \\\\ =~ & \\frac 1{84} \\cdot \\frac{84\\cdot 85}2 - 35 \\\\ =~ & \\frac{85}2 - 35 \\\\ =~ & \\frac{15}2 \\end{align*} Hence the total sum of distances is $\\frac{83}2 + \\frac{15}2 = 49$ . By the triangle inequality, $|x-1|+|2x-1|+|3x-1|+\\cdots + |119x-1| \\geq |(x-1)+(2x-1)+\\cdots+(119x)-1|.$ However, we may change signs of some of these terms to cancel out the $x$ 's.\n",
      "Since the minimum exists, we want all the $x$ s to cancel out. Thus, we want to find some $n$ such that \\[1+2+3+...+n=(n+1)+(n+2)+(n+3)+...+119\\]  \\[\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}=\\frac{119\\cdot120}{2}-\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\\]  \\[n^2+n-7140=0\\]  \\[n=84\\]  Then, $x=\\frac{1}{n}= \\frac{1}{84}$ . The answer(expression's value) is then $84*1+(119-85+1)*(-1)$ , which becomes $84-35=\\boxed{49}$ . https://youtu.be/lu4jlTNUYrQ  ~r00tsOfUnity   2010 AMC 12A ( Problems • Answer Key • Resources )   Preceded by Problem 21   Followed by Problem 23    1  •  2  •  3  •  4  •  5  •  6  •  7  •  8  •  9  •  10  •  11  •  12  •  13  •  14  •  15  •  16  •  17  •  18  •  19  •  20  •  21  •  22  •  23  •  24  •  25    All AMC 12 Problems and Solutions  The problems on this page are copyrighted by the Mathematical Association of America 's American Mathematics Competitions .

      " We will use the fact that for any integer $n$ , \\begin{align*}(5n+1)(5n+2)(5n+3)(5n+4)&=[(5n+4)(5n+1)][(5n+2)(5n+3)]\\\\ &=(25n^2+25n+4)(25n^2+25n+6)\\equiv 4\\cdot 6\\\\ &=24\\pmod{25}\\equiv -1\\pmod{25}.\\end{align*}  First, we find that the number of factors of $10$ in $90!$ is equal to $\\left\\lfloor \\frac{90}5\\right\\rfloor+\\left\\lfloor\\frac{90}{25}\\right\\rfloor=18+3=21$ . Let $N=\\frac{90!}{10^{21}}$ . The $n$ we want is therefore the last two digits of $N$ , or $N\\pmod{100}$ . If instead we find $N\\pmod{25}$ , we know that $N\\pmod{100}$ , what we are looking for, could be $N\\pmod{25}$ , $N\\pmod{25}+25$ , $N\\pmod{25}+50$ , or $N\\pmod{25}+75$ . Only one of these numbers will be a multiple of four, and whichever one that is will be the answer, because $N\\pmod{100}$ has to be a multiple of 4. If we divide $N$ by $5^{21}$ by taking out all the factors of $5$ in $N$ , we can write $N$ as $\\frac M{2^{21}}$ where \\[M=1\\cdot 2\\cdot 3\\cdot 4\\cdot 1\\cdot 6\\cdot 7\\cdot 8\\cdot 9\\cdot 2\\cdots 89\\cdot 18,\\] where every multiple of 5 is replaced by the number with all its factors of 5 removed. Specifically, every number in the form $5n$ is replaced by $n$ , and every number in the form $25n$ is replaced by $n$ . The number $M$ can be grouped as follows: \\begin{align*}M= &(1\\cdot 2\\cdot 3\\cdot 4)(6\\cdot 7\\cdot 8\\cdot 9)\\cdots(86\\cdot 87\\cdot 88\\cdot 89)\\\\ &\\cdot (1\\cdot 2\\cdot 3\\cdot 4)(6\\cdot 7\\cdot 8\\cdot 9)\\cdots (16\\cdot 17\\cdot 18) \\\\ &\\cdot (1\\cdot 2\\cdot 3).\\end{align*}  Where the first line is composed of the numbers in $90!$ that aren't multiples of five, the second line is the multiples of five and not 25 after they have been divided by five, and the third line is multiples of 25 after they have been divided by 25. Using the identity at the beginning of the solution, we can reduce $M$ to \\begin{align*}M&\\equiv(-1)^{18} \\cdot (-1)^3(16\\cdot 17\\cdot 18) \\cdot (1\\cdot 2\\cdot 3) \\\\ &= 1\\cdot -21\\cdot 6\\\\ &= -1\\pmod{25} =24\\pmod{25}.\\end{align*}  Using the fact that $2^{10}=1024\\equiv -1\\pmod{25}$ (or simply the fact that $2^{21}=2097152$ if you have your powers of 2 memorized), we can deduce that $2^{21}\\equiv 2\\pmod{25}$ . Therefore $N=\\frac M{2^{21}}\\equiv \\frac {24}2\\pmod{25}=12\\pmod{25}$ . Finally, combining with the fact that $N\\equiv 0\\pmod 4$ yields $n=\\boxed{\\textbf{(A)}\\ 12}$ . Let $P$ be $90!$ after we truncate its zeros. Notice that $90!$ has exactly (floored) $\\left\\lfloor\\frac{90}{5}\\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor\\frac{90}{25}\\right\\rfloor = 21$ factors of 5; thus, \\[P = 2^{-21}\\cdot 5^{-21}\\cdot 90!.\\] We shall consider $P$ modulo 4 and 25, to determine its residue modulo 100. It is easy to prove that $P$ is divisible by 4 (consider the number of 2s dividing $90!$ minus the number of 5s dividing $90!$ ), and so we only need to consider $P$ modulo 25. Now, notice that for integers $a, n$ we have \\[(5n + a)(5n - a) \\equiv -a^2 \\mod 25.\\]  Thus, for integral a: \\[(10a + 1)(10a + 2)(10a + 3)(10a + 4)(10a + 6)(10a + 7)(10a + 8)(10a + 9) \\equiv (-1)(-4)(-9)(-16) \\equiv 576 \\equiv 1 \\mod 25.\\] Using this process, we can essentially remove all the numbers which had not formerly been a multiple of 5 in $90!$ from consideration. Now, we consider the remnants of the 5, 10, 15, 20, ..., 90 not yet eliminated. After factoring out a 2 from each of the 9 even numbers in this sequence, the 10, 20, 30, ..., 90 becomes 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 6, 7, 8, 9, whose product is 1 mod 25. We have accounted for 9 of the 21 2's thus we still need to multiply by $2^{-12}$ . Also, the 5, 15, 25, ..., 85 becomes 1, 3, 1, 7, 9, 11, 13, 3, 17. Multiplying out 1, 3, 1, 7, ..., 17 yields 2 modulo 25, and so we are left to compute $2^{-11}$ . Also note that $\\phi(25)=5^2-5^1=20$ . Euler's Theorem states that $2^{\\phi(25)} \\equiv 1 \\mod 25$ , thus $2^{-11} \\equiv 2^{-11+20} = 2^9 = 512 \\equiv 12 \\mod 25$ . Because 12 is also a multiple of 4, we can utilize the Chinese Remainder Theorem to show that $P \\equiv 12 \\mod 100$ and so the answer is $\\boxed{12}$ . We start of by truncating the $0$ s off $90!$ , just like Solution 2. Since there are $v_5(90!) = \\left\\lfloor\\frac{90}{5}\\right\\rfloor+\\left\\lfloor\\frac{90}{25}\\right\\rfloor = 21$ terminating zeroes, we have the number we obtain from truncating the terminating zeroes at the end of $90!$ will be $\\frac{90!}{10^{21}}$ . By Chinese Remainder Theorem , we can divide the mod $100$ into mod $4$ and mod $25$ . We know that there are way more than $23$  $2$ s in $90!$ , so we have \\[\\dfrac{90!}{10^{21}} \\equiv 0 \\text{ } \\text{ (mod } 4 \\text{)}\\]  Now, notice that $\\frac{90!}{5^{21}}$ is basically $90!$ without any factors that are multiples of $5$ . \\[1\\cdot 2\\cdot 3\\cdot 4\\cdot 6\\cdot 7\\cdots 23\\cdot 24 \\text{ } \\text{ (mod } 25 \\text{)}\\]  We can rewrite the expression as \\[(1\\cdot 2\\cdot 3\\cdot 4\\cdot 6\\cdot 7\\cdots 12)^2 \\text{ } \\text{ (mod } 25 \\text{)}\\]  We also have \\[1\\cdot 2\\cdot 3\\cdot 4\\cdot 6\\cdot 7\\cdots 12 \\equiv 8\\cdot 8\\cdot 9\\cdot 11\\cdot 12 \\equiv 7 \\text{ } \\text{ (mod } 25 \\text{)}\\]  Squaring the expression gets us \\[(1\\cdot 2\\cdot 3\\cdot 4\\cdot 6\\cdot 7\\cdots 12)^2 \\equiv 49 \\equiv -1 \\text{ } \\text{ (mod } 25 \\text{)}\\]  Notice that there are $3$ of this string of numbers multiplied together occurs four times in $\\frac{90!}{10^{21}}$ , the fourth being only a partial $1\\cdot 2\\cdot 3\\cdot 4\\cdots 14 \\equiv 24 \\equiv -1 \\text{ } \\text{ (mod } 25 \\text{)}$  Multiplying these together gives us \\[\\frac{90!}{10^{21}} \\equiv \\frac{\\frac{90!}{5^{21}}}{2^{21}} \\equiv \\frac{(-1)^4}{2^{21}} \\equiv \\frac{1}{2^{21}} \\text{ } \\text{ (mod } 25 \\text{)}\\]  By Euler's Theorem, we have $\\frac{1}{2^{21}} \\equiv 12^{21} \\equiv 12^{\\phi{(25)}}\\cdot 12 \\equiv 12 \\text{ } \\text{ (mod } 25 \\text{)}$  Thus, we want to solve $x \\equiv 12 \\text{ } \\text{ (mod } 25 \\text{)}$ and $x \\equiv 0 \\text{ } \\text{ (mod } 4 \\text{)}$ . An obvious solution is $x\\equiv 12$ and by Chinese Remainder Theorem, we have $x\\equiv 12$ is the only solution.

      " The question asks for the number of disjoint open intervals, which means we need to find the number of disjoint intervals such that the function is defined within them. We note that since all of the $\\sin$ factors are inside a logarithm, the function is undefined where the inside of the logarithm is less than or equal to $0$ . First, let us find the number of zeros of the inside of the logarithm. \\begin{align*}\\sin(\\pi x) \\cdot \\sin(2 \\pi x) \\cdot \\sin (3 \\pi x) \\cdots \\sin(8 \\pi x) &= 0\\\\ \\sin(\\pi x) &= 0\\\\ x &= 0, 1\\\\ \\sin(2 \\pi x) &= 0\\\\ x &= 0, \\frac{1}{2}, 1\\\\ \\sin(3 \\pi x) &= 0\\\\ x &= 0, \\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{2}{3}, 1\\\\ \\sin(4 \\pi x) &= 0\\\\ x &= 0, \\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{2}{4}, \\frac{3}{4}, 1\\\\ &\\cdots\\end{align*}  After counting up the number of zeros for each factor and eliminating the excess cases we get $23$ zeros and $22$ intervals. In order to find which intervals are negative, we must first realize that at every zero of each factor, the sign changes. We also have to be careful, as some zeros are doubled, or even tripled, quadrupled, etc. The first interval $\\left(0, \\frac{1}{8}\\right)$ is obviously positive. This means the next interval $\\left(\\frac{1}{8}, \\frac{1}{7}\\right)$ is negative. Continuing the pattern and accounting for doubled roots (which do not flip sign), we realize that there are $5$ negative intervals from $0$ to $\\frac{1}{2}$ . Since the function is symmetric, we know that there are also $5$ negative intervals from $\\frac{1}{2}$ to $1$ . And so, the total number of disjoint open intervals is $22 - 2\\cdot{5} = \\boxed{12\\ \\textbf{(B)}}$  Note that the expression $\\sin(\\pi x) \\cdot \\sin(2 \\pi x) \\cdot \\sin (3 \\pi x) \\cdots \\sin(8 \\pi x)$ must be greater than zero, since logarithm functions are undefined for $0$ and negative numbers. Let $x_1, x_2, x_3, ..., x_8$ temporarily be the dependent variables of the functions $y_1 = \\sin(\\pi x_1), y_2 = \\sin(2\\pi x_2), ..., y_8 = \\sin(8\\pi x_8)$ . It is easy to see that for $y_i$ to be positive for $1\\leq i\\leq8$ , $\\lfloor i x_i \\rfloor$ must be even for $1 \\leq i\\leq8$ . Since an even number of positives times an even number of negatives equals a positive, there can be $2, 4, 6,$ or $8$ positive values of $y_i$ for $1 \\leq i\\leq 8$ for a given value of $x$ . (since $y_1$ is always positive on the range $[0, 1]$ )\n",
      "Since MAA allows rulers (and you should bring one to the actual exam), use it to your advantage and draw a larged scaled number line from $0$ to $1$ . (I recommend increments of at most $0.1$ .) If you don't have a ruler but have graph paper, you can use that instead. Then, designate rows for $y_1, y_2, ..., y_8$ , respectively. Draw a large bar (label it with $+$ so you know it's positive) for all values of $x_i$ such that $\\lfloor i x_i \\rfloor$ is even, and do that for all eight rows. Then, use your ruler (or another viable straightedge, such as the edge of another sheet of paper), place the straightedge perpendicular to the vertical line on your digram at $0$ , and slowly work your way to $1$ , marking all disjoint intervals in which your straightedge touches $2, 4, 6,$ or $8$ boxes simultaneously. (If an interval excludes a value in that interval, you still have to count it as two disjoint intervals. Note that this will be important as to not undercounting disjoint intervals. )\n",
      "If done correctly, you should obtain $\\boxed{12\\ \\textbf{(B)}}$ as your answer. ~FidgetBoss 4000 You should be able to somewhat visualize what the $\\sin$ function looks like (if you can't then you should look it up and try to memorize it). To summarize, the graph of $y= \\sin{x}$ is positive from the interval $(0, \\pi)$ and negative from the interval $(\\pi, 2\\pi)$ (notice how the intervals use parentheses instead of brackets, as brackets would denote inclusive bounds and that it incorrect). All of the various $\\sin$ functions that we are multiplying are in the form of $k\\pi x$ , which means the intervals have now changed to integer values. Also, the period of the function $y =\\sin{k \\pi x}$ is equivalent to $\\frac{2}{k}$ ; For example the period of $y=  \\sin{4\\pi x}$ is $\\frac{1}{2}$ . Let a \"wave\" be a full period of a $\\sin$ curve. Then, a \"half-wave\" is half of a full period of a $\\sin$ curve. Over the interval $[0, 1],$  $y= \\sin{\\pi x}$ will display $1$ \"half-wave\", $y= \\sin{2\\pi x}$ will display $2$ \"half-waves\", and $y= \\sin{k\\pi x}$ will display $k$ \"half-waves\". Also notice that the graph of $y= \\sin{k \\pi x}$ crosses the $x$ -axis exactly $k-1$ times over the interval $(0, 1)$ . The problem asks for the number of disjoint intervals, not the values of the intervals themselves. This means we only want the positive values of  $\\prod_{k=1}^8 \\sin{k\\pi x}$  (the product of all of the various $\\sin$ functions) We don't care about the specific values themselves, we just need to know what the sign (+/-) of the product is. Notice that if an even number of the functions are negative, the product will be positive; conversely, if the number of negative functions is odd, the product will be negative. Therefore we only need to count the number of intervals during which an even number of functions are negative/positive. By definition, the sign of a function changes after it crosses one of its roots (because trig functions don't have multiplicities). Notice that the roots of $y = \\sin{k\\pi x}$ are in the form  $\\frac{1}{k}, \\frac{2}{k}, \\frac{3}{k},...$  (this is in agreement with the fact that $y= \\sin{k \\pi x}$ crosses the $x$ -axis exactly $k-1$ times over the interval $(0, 1)$ ) Therefore, across the interval $[0, 1]$ , the sign will change every time the function hits a root of one of the $\\sin$ functions. We must be careful, however, as some roots (such as $\\frac{1}{2}$ and $\\frac{2}{4}$ ) are duplicates. Notice that the duplicates always come in pairs. For example, $\\frac{1}{2}$ is also $\\frac{2}{4}, \\frac{3}{6},$ and $\\frac{4}{8}$ ; there are four equivalent roots. Across the interval $[0, 1],$ there are no duplicate roots that come in triplets, or in fives. The roots are always single, doubled up, or quadrupled up. So every time the function reaches a single root, it switches signs, and every time it reaches a duplicate root, the sign remains the same (this still counts as 2 distinct intervals, though, as the zeroes \"separate\" them).

      " It should first be noted that given any quadrilateral of fixed side lengths, there is exactly one way to manipulate the angles so that the quadrilateral becomes cyclic. Proof. Given a quadrilateral $ABCD$ where all sides are fixed (in a certain order), we can construct the diagonal $\\overline{BD}$ . When $BD$ is the minimum allowed by the triangle inequality, one of the angles $\\angle DAB$ or $\\angle BCD$ will be degenerate and measure $0^\\circ$ , so opposite angles will sum to less than $180^\\circ$ . When $BD$ is the maximum allowed, one of the angles will be degenerate and measure $180^\\circ$ , so opposite angles will sum to more than $180^\\circ$ . Thus, since the sum of opposite angles increases continuously as $BD$ is lengthened from the minimum to the maximum values, there is a unique value of $BD$ somewhere in the middle such that the sum of opposite angles is exactly $180^\\circ$ . Denote $a$ , $b$ , $c$ , and $d$ as the integer side lengths of the quadrilateral. Without loss of generality, let $a\\ge b \\ge c \\ge d$ . Since $a+b+c+d = 32$ , the Triangle Inequality implies that $a \\le 15$ . We will now split into $5$ cases. Case $1$ : $a = b = c = d$ ( $4$ side lengths are equal) Clearly there is only $1$ way to select the side lengths $(8,8,8,8)$ , and no matter how the sides are rearranged only $1$ unique quadrilateral can be formed. Case $2$ : $a = b = c > d$ or $a > b = c = d$ ( $3$ side lengths are equal) If $3$ side lengths are equal, then each of those side lengths can only be integers from $6$ to $10$ except for $8$ (because that is counted in the first case). Obviously there is still only $1$ unique quadrilateral that can be formed from one set of side lengths, resulting in a total of $4$ quadrilaterals. Case $3$ : $a = b > c = d$ ( $2$ pairs of side lengths are equal) $a$ and $b$ can be any integer from $9$ to $15$ , and likewise $c$ and $d$ can be any integer from $1$ to $7$ . However, a single set of side lengths can form $2$ different cyclic quadrilaterals (a rectangle and a kite), so the total number of quadrilaterals for this case is $7\\cdot{2} = 14$ . Case $4$ : $a = b > c > d$ or $a > b = c > d$ or $a > b > c = d$ ( $2$ side lengths are equal) If the $2$ equal side lengths are each $1$ , then the other $2$ sides must each be $15$ , which we have already counted in an earlier case. If the equal side lengths are each $2$ , there is $1$ possible set of side lengths. Likewise, for side lengths of $3$ there are $2$ sets. Continuing this pattern, we find a total of $1+2+3+4+4+5+7+5+4+4+3+2+1 = 45$ sets of side lengths. (Be VERY careful when adding up the total for this case!) For each set of side lengths, there are $3$ possible quadrilaterals that can be formed, so the total number of quadrilaterals for this case is $3\\cdot{45} = 135$ . Case $5$ : $a > b > c > d$ (no side lengths are equal)\n",
      "Using the same counting principles starting from $a = 15$ and eventually reaching $a = 9$ , we find that the total number of possible side lengths is $69$ . There are $4!$ ways to arrange the $4$ side lengths, but there is only $1$ unique quadrilateral for $4$ rotations, so the number of quadrilaterals for each set of side lengths is $\\frac{4!}{4} = 6$ . The total number of quadrilaterals is $6\\cdot{69} = 414$ . And so, the total number of quadrilaterals that can be made is $414 + 135 + 14 + 4 + 1 = \\boxed{568\\ \\textbf{(C)}}$ . As with solution $1$ we would  like to note that given any quadrilateral we can change its angles to make a cyclic one. Let $a \\ge b \\ge c\\ge d$ be the sides of the quadrilateral. There are $\\binom{31}{3}$ ways to partition $32$ . However, some of these will not be quadrilaterals since they would have one side bigger than the sum of the other three.  This occurs when $a \\ge 16$ .  For $a=16$ , $b+c+d=16$ . There are $\\binom{15}{2}$ ways to partition $16$ . Since $a$ could be any of the four sides, we have counted $4\\binom{15}{2}$ degenerate quadrilaterals. Similarly, there are $4\\binom{14}{2}$ , $4\\binom{13}{2} \\cdots 4\\binom{2}{2}$ for other values of $a$ .  Thus, there are $\\binom{31}{3} - 4\\left(\\binom{15}{2}+\\binom{14}{2}+\\cdots+\\binom{2}{2}\\right) = \\binom{31}{3} - 4\\binom{16}{3} = 2255$ non-degenerate partitions of $32$ by the hockey stick theorem.  We then account for symmetry. If all sides are congruent (meaning the quadrilateral is a square), the quadrilateral will be counted once. If the quadrilateral is a rectangle (and not a square), it will be counted twice. In all other cases, it will be counted 4 times. Since there is $1$ square case, and $7$ rectangle cases, there are $2255-1-2\\cdot7=2240$ quadrilaterals counted 4 times. Thus there are $1+7+\\frac{2240}{4} = \\boxed{568} = \\boxed{\\textbf{(C)}}$ total quadrilaterals. As with solution $1$ we find that there are $2255$ ways to form a quadrilateral if we don't account for rotations. We now apply Burnside's_Lemma . There are four types of actions in the group acting on the set of quadrilaterals. We will consider each individually:\n",
      "Identity: maps a quadrilateral with sides $a,b,c,d$ in that order to $a,b,c,d$ . Obviously all members of the set of quadrilaterals are fixed points, for a total of $2255$ .\n",
      "Rotation by one: maps a quadrilateral from $a,b,c,d$ to $b,c,d,a$ . For this to have a fixed point we need $a=b,b=c,c=d,d=a$ , so the only quadrilateral that is a fixed point is the square with side length $8$ , for a total of $1$ .\n",
      "Rotation by two: maps a quadrilateral from $a,b,c,d$ to $c,d,a,b$ . For this to be a fixed point we need $a=c$ and $b=d$ . Thus the quadrilateral is of the form $x,y,x,y$ —a rectangle. We can count that there are $15$ rectangle cases, namely $(a, b, c, d) = \\{ (1, 15, 1, 15), (2, 14, 2, 14), \\cdots, (15, 1, 15, 1)  \\}$ .\n",
      "Roration by three: maps a quadrilateral from $a,b,c,d$ to $d,a,b,c$ . Similarly to the rotation by one case, there is one fixed point here.\n",
      "Summing up, we get that the total number of groups is $2255+1+15+1=2272$ . Since there are $4$ members of the group our final answer is $\\frac{2272}{4}=\\boxed{568}$ total orbits of the set of quadrilaterals, so the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{C}}$ .   2010 AMC 12A ( Problems • Answer Key • Resources )   Preceded by Problem 24   Followed by Last Problem    1  •  2  •  3  •  4  •  5  •  6  •  7  •  8  •  9  •  10  •  11  •  12  •  13  •  14  •  15  •  16  •  17  •  18  •  19  •  20  •  21  •  22  •  23  •  24  •  25    All AMC 12 Problems and Solutions  The problems on this page are copyrighted by the Mathematical Association of America 's American Mathematics Competitions .

      " There are $x$ schools. This means that there are $3x$ people. Because no one's score was the same as another person's score, that means that there could only have been $1$ median score.

      " We know that $n^2 = k^3$ and $n^3 = m^2$ . Cubing and squaring the equalities respectively gives $n^6 = k^9 = m^4$ . Let $a = n^6$ . Now we know $a$ must be a perfect $36$ -th power because $lcm(9,4) = 36$ , which means that $n$ must be a perfect $6$ -th power. The smallest number whose sixth power is a multiple of $20$ is $10$ , because the only prime factors of $20$ are $2$ and $5$ , and $10 = 2 \\times 5$ . Therefore our is equal to number $10^6 = 1000000$ , with $7$ digits $\\Rightarrow \\boxed {E}$ . Let $n = 2^2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot x$ for some integer $x$ , then we know that n 2 = 2 4 ⋅ 5 2 ⋅ x 2 = m 0 3 n 3 = 2 6 ⋅ 5 3 ⋅ x 3 = m 1 2 Since we have $2^4 \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot x^2$ a power of 3, that means, by the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, the exponents of the primes must each be divisible by 3. This also means that there's no point in $p \\mid x$ if $p \\not \\in \\{2,3\\}$ , since that would just serve to increase $n$ and we want $n$ to be minimal. This means we can write $x = 2^{\\alpha} \\cdot 5^{\\beta}$ and thus we have $2^4 \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 2^{2\\alpha} \\cdot 5^{2\\beta} = 2^{4 + 2\\alpha} \\cdot 5^{2 + 2\\beta} = m_0^3$ , therefore we know 4 + 2 α ≡ 0 ( mod 3 ) 2 + 2 β ≡ 0 ( mod 3 ) and doing the same with the third equation being a square, we have 6 + 3 α ≡ 0 ( mod 2 ) 3 + 3 β ≡ 0 ( mod 2 ) We can shift this around into two systems involving the same variables, as follows: α ≡ 0 ( mod 2 ) 1 + 2 α ≡ 0 ( mod 3 ) and 1 + β ≡ 0 ( mod 2 ) 2 + 2 β ≡ 0 ( mod 3 ) And using Chinese Remainder Theorem to solve this, we get $\\alpha = 4$ and $\\beta = 5$ , and plugging that back in yields $n = 2^6 \\cdot 5^6$ .

      " View the palindrome as some number with form (decimal representation): $a_3 \\cdot 10^3 + a_2 \\cdot 10^2 + a_1 \\cdot 10 + a_0$ . But because the number is a palindrome, $a_3 = a_0, a_2 = a_1$ . Recombining this yields $1001a_3 + 110a_2$ . 1001 is divisible by 7, which means that as long as $a_2 = 0$ , the palindrome will be divisible by 7. This yields 9 palindromes out of 90 ( $9 \\cdot 10$ ) possibilities for palindromes. However, if $a_2 = 7$ , then this gives another case in which the palindrome is divisible by 7. This adds another 9 palindromes to the list, bringing our total to $18/90 = \\boxed {\\frac{1}{5} } = \\boxed {E}$  We can notice the palindrome is of the form $\\overline{abba}$ .

In order to express $2010$ as a sum of $5$ numbers, we must split up some of these numbers. There are two ways to do this (while keeping the sum of two numbers as close as possible): $2010=670+1+670+1+668$ or $2010=670+1+669+1+669$ . We see that in both cases, the value of $M$ is $671$ , so the answer is $671 \\Rightarrow \\boxed{B}$ . Since $a + b \\le M$ , $d + e \\le M$ , and $c < b + c \\le M$ , we have that $2010 = a + b + c + d + e < 3M$ . Hence, $M > 670$ , or $M \\ge 671$ .

Dividing $2010$ by $3$ yields $670$ , or ( $670, 0, 670, 0, 670$ ) However, all five numbers must be positive, and the closest we can get to this is ( $668, 3, 668, 3, 668$ ) The lowest possible sum of two adjacent numbers then becomes $671$ , or $\\boxed{B}$ .   2010 AMC 12B ( Problems • Answer Key • Resources )   Preceded by Problem 13   Followed by Problem 15    1  •  2  •  3  •  4  •  5  •  6  •  7  •  8  •  9  •  10  •  11  •  12  •  13  •  14  •  15  •  16  •  17  •  18  •  19  •  20  •  21  •  22  •  23  •  24  •  25    All AMC 12 Problems and Solutions  The problems on this page are copyrighted by the Mathematical Association of America 's American Mathematics Competitions .

The numerator is simpler: the factorial of the number of squares.

      " Here's a funny solution: this problem reduces to picking three vectors on the unit circle and asking when the sum of these vectors also lies in the unit circle. But it's well known that the sum of these three vectors is the orthocenter of the triangle whose vertices are the heads of the three vectors. Also, it's well known that the orthocenter of a triangle lies inside its circumcircle iff the triangle is acute. Therefore, this problem is equivalent to asking when three randomly chosen points on a circle form an acute triangle. This is a classic problem, and it's well known that the answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4} \\text{(C)}}$ . ~ ihatemath123   2010 AMC 12B ( Problems • Answer Key • Resources )   Preceded by Problem 17   Followed by Problem 19    1  •  2  •  3  •  4  •  5  •  6  •  7  •  8  •  9  •  10  •  11  •  12  •  13  •  14  •  15  •  16  •  17  •  18  •  19  •  20  •  21  •  22  •  23  •  24  •  25    All AMC 12 Problems and Solutions  The problems on this page are copyrighted by the Mathematical Association of America 's American Mathematics Competitions .

      " Let $a,ar,ar^{2},ar^{3}$ be the quarterly scores for the Raiders. We know $r > 1$ because the sequence is said to be increasing. We also know that each of $a, ar, ar^2, ar^3$ is an integer. We start by showing that $r$ must also be an integer.  Suppose not, and say $r = m/n$ where $m>n>1$ , and $\\gcd(m,n)=1$ . Then $n, n^2, n^3$ must all divide $a$ so $a=n^3k$ for some integer $k$ . Then $S_R = n^3k + n^2mk + nm^2k + m^3k < 100$ and we see that even if $k=1$ and $n=2$ , we get $m < 4$ , which means that the only option for $r$ is $r=3/2$ . A quick check shows that even this doesn't work. Thus $r$ must be an integer. Let $a, a+d, a+2d, a+3d$ be the quarterly scores for the Wildcats. Let $S_W = a+(a+d) + (a+2d)+(a+3d) = 4a+6d$ . Let $S_R = a+ar+ar^2+ar^3 = a(1+r)(1+r^2)$ . Then $S_R<100$ implies that $r<5$ , so $r\\in \\{2, 3, 4\\}$ . The Raiders win by one point, so \\[a(1+r)(1+r^2) = 4a+6d+1.\\]  If $r=4$ we get $85a = 4a+6d+1$ which means $3(27a-2d) = 1$ , which is not possible with the given conditions.  If $r=3$ we get $40a = 4a+6d+1$ which means $6(6a-d) = 1$ , which is also not possible with the given conditions.  If $r=2$ we get $15a = 4a+6d+1$ which means $11a-6d = 1$ . Reducing modulo 6 we get $a \\equiv 5\\pmod{6}$ . Since $15a<100$ we get $a<7$ . Thus $a=5$ . It then follows that $d=9$ . Then the quarterly scores for the Raiders are $5, 10, 20, 40$ , and those for the Wildcats are $5, 14, 23, 32$ . Also $S_R = 75 = S_W + 1$ . The total number of points scored by the two teams in the first half is $5+10+5+14=\\boxed{\\textbf{(E)}\\ 34}$ . Note if you don't realize while taking the test that $r$ might not be an integer: since an answer is achieved through casework on the integer value of $r$ and since there is only one right answer, the proof of $r$ being an integer can be skipped on the test (it takes up time). Let $a,ar,ar^{2},ar^{3}$ be the quarterly scores for the Raiders. We know that the Raiders and Wildcats both scored the same number of points in the first quarter so let $a,a+d,a+2d,a+3d$ be the quarterly scores for the Wildcats. The sum of the Raiders scores is $a(1+r+r^{2}+r^{3})$ and the sum of the Wildcats scores is $4a+6d$ . Now we can narrow our search for the values of $a,d$ , and $r$ . Because points are always measured in positive integers, we can conclude that $a$ and $d$ are positive integers. We can also conclude that $r$ is a positive integer by writing down the equation: \\[a(1+r+r^{2}+r^{3})=4a+6d+1\\]  Now we can start trying out some values of $r$ . We try $r=2$ , which gives \\[15a=4a+6d+1\\]  \\[11a=6d+1\\]  We need the smallest multiple of $11$ (to satisfy the <100 condition) that is $\\equiv 1 \\pmod{6}$ . We see that this is $55$ , and therefore $a=5$ and $d=9$ . So the Raiders' first two scores were $5$ and $10$ and the Wildcats' first two scores were $5$ and $14$ . \\[5+10+5+14=34 \\longrightarrow \\boxed{\\textbf{(E)}}\\]  It should become apparent that the geometric ratio is less than or equal to $2$ (try the first quarter $1$ , ratio $3$ ). Obviously, the ratio is more than $1$ , so we try the ratio of $2$  $1, 2, 4, 8$ - The Raiders $1, ?, ?, ?$ - The Wildcats To find the $?$ s, we need the sum of the raiders, which is $15$ . $15-1=14$ , and $\\frac{14}2=7$ . So the last term is $7-1=6$ . But, now we can't have integrated 2nd and 3rd quarter scores, so we stop. $2, 4, 8, 16$ - The Raiders, this also fails (try it out) The same goes for $3, 6, 12, 24$ , and $4, 8, 16, 32$ . With $5, 10, 20, 40$ we get: $5, 10, 20, 40$ - The Raiders $5, ?, ?, ?$ - The wildcats $5+10+20+40=75$ , $75-1=74$ , $\\frac{74}2=37$ , $37-5=32$  $5, ?, ?, 32$ - The Wildcats. Now, we can finish the arithmetic progression: $5, 14, 23, 32$ - The Wildcats Thus our answer is $5+10+5+14=34$  ~ firebolt360 https://youtu.be/krRrPxRdgD0  ~IceMatrix   2010 AMC 12B ( Problems • Answer Key • Resources )   Preceded by Problem 18   Followed by Problem 20    1  •  2  •  3  •  4  •  5  •  6  •  7  •  8  •  9  •  10  •  11  •  12  •  13  •  14  •  15  •  16  •  17  •  18  •  19  •  20  •  21  •  22  •  23  •  24  •  25    All AMC 12 Problems and Solutions    2010 AMC 10B ( Problems • Answer Key • Resources )   Preceded by Problem 23   Followed by Problem 25    1  •  2  •  3  •  4  •  5  •  6  •  7  •  8  •  9  •  10  •  11  •  12  •  13  •  14  •  15  •  16  •  17  •  18  •  19  •  20  •  21  •  22  •  23  •  24  •  25    All AMC 10 Problems and Solutions  The problems on this page are copyrighted by the Mathematical Association of America 's American Mathematics Competitions .

      " By the defintion of a geometric sequence, we have $\\cos^2x=\\sin x \\tan x$ . Since $\\tan x=\\frac{\\sin x}{\\cos x}$ , we can rewrite this as $\\cos^3x=\\sin^2x$ . The common ratio of the sequence is $\\frac{\\cos x}{\\sin x}$ , so we can write \\[a_1= \\sin x\\]  \\[a_2= \\cos x\\]  \\[a_3= \\frac{\\cos^2x}{\\sin x}\\]  \\[a_4=\\frac{\\cos^3x}{\\sin^2x}=1\\]  \\[a_5=\\frac{\\cos x}{\\sin x}\\]  \\[a_6=\\frac{\\cos^2x}{\\sin^2x}\\]  \\[a_7=\\frac{\\cos^3x}{\\sin^3x}=\\frac{1}{\\sin x}\\]  \\[a_8=\\frac{\\cos x}{\\sin^2 x}=\\frac{1}{\\cos^2 x}\\]  Since $\\cos^3x=\\sin^2x=1-\\cos^2x$ , we have $\\cos^3x+\\cos^2x=1 \\implies \\cos^2x(\\cos x+1)=1 \\implies \\cos x+1=\\frac{1}{\\cos^2 x}$ , which is $a_8$ , making our answer $8 \\Rightarrow \\boxed{E}$ . Notice that the common ratio is $r=\\frac{\\cos(x)}{\\sin(x)}$ ; multiplying it to $\\tan(x)=\\frac{\\sin(x)}{\\cos(x)}$ gives $a_4=1$ .

      " We observe that because $P(1) = P(3) = P(5) = P(7) = a$ , if we define a new polynomial $R(x)$ such that $R(x) = P(x) - a$ , $R(x)$ has roots when $P(x) = a$ ; namely, when $x=1,3,5,7$ . Thus since $R(x)$ has roots when $x=1,3,5,7$ , we can factor the product $(x-1)(x-3)(x-5)(x-7)$ out of $R(x)$ to obtain a new polynomial $Q(x)$ such that $(x-1)(x-3)(x-5)(x-7)(Q(x)) = R(x) = P(x) - a$ . Then, plugging in values of $2,4,6,8,$ we get \\[P(2)-a=(2-1)(2-3)(2-5)(2-7)Q(2) = -15Q(2) = -2a\\]  \\[P(4)-a=(4-1)(4-3)(4-5)(4-7)Q(4) = 9Q(4) = -2a\\]  \\[P(6)-a=(6-1)(6-3)(6-5)(6-7)Q(6) = -15Q(6) = -2a\\]  \\[P(8)-a=(8-1)(8-3)(8-5)(8-7)Q(8) = 105Q(8) = -2a\\]  $-2a=-15Q(2)=9Q(4)=-15Q(6)=105Q(8).$ Thus, the least value of $a$ must be the $\\text{lcm}(15,9,15,105)$ .\n",
      "Solving, we receive $315$ , so our answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B)}\\ 315}$ . To complete the solution, we can let $a = 315$ , and then try to find $Q(x)$ . We know from the above calculation that $Q(2)=42, Q(4)=-70, Q(6)=42$ , and $Q(8)=-6$ . Then we can let $Q(x) = T(x)(x-2)(x-6)+42$ , getting $T(4)=28, T(8)=-4$ . Let $T(x)=L(x)(x-8)-4$ , then $L(4)=-8$ . Therefore, it is possible to choose $T(x) = -8(x-8)-4 = -8x + 60$ , so the goal is accomplished. As a reference, the polynomial we get is \\[P(x) = (x-1)(x-3)(x-5)(x-7)((-8x + 60)(x-2)(x-6)+42) + 315\\]  \\[= -8 x^7+252 x^6-3248 x^5+22050 x^4-84392 x^3+179928 x^2-194592 x+80325\\]  The evenly-spaced data suggests using discrete derivatives to tackle this problem.  First, note that any polynomial of degree $n$  $P(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + \\ldots + a_n x^n$ can also be written as $P(x) = b_0 + b_1 (x-1) + b_2 (x-1)(x-2) + \\ldots + b_n (x-1)(x-1) \\cdots (x-n)$ . Moreover, the coefficients $a_i$ are integers for $i=1, 2, \\ldots n$ iff the coefficients $b_i$ are integers for $i=1, 2, \\ldots n$ .  This latter form is convenient for calculating discrete derivatives of $P(x)$ . The discrete derivative of a function $f(x)$ is the related function $\\Delta f(x)$ defined as $\\Delta f(x) = f(x+1) - f(x)$ . With this definition, it's easy to see that for any positive integer $k$ we have $\\Delta [(x-1)(x-2)\\cdots(x-k)] = k(x-1)(x-2)\\cdots(x-[k-1])$ . This in turn allows us to use successive discrete derivatives evaluated at $x=1$ to calculate all of the coefficients $b_i$ using $P(1)=b_0$ , $\\Delta P(1) = b_1$ , $\\Delta^2 P(1) = 2 b_2$ , $\\ldots$ , $\\Delta^7 P(1) = 7! b_7$ . We can also calculate the following table of discrete derivatives based on the data points given in the problem statement:   $x$  $1$ $2$ $3$ $4$ $5$ $6$ $7$ $8$  $P(x)$ $a$ $-a$ $a$ $-a$ $a$ $-a$ $a$ $-a$  $\\Delta P(x)$ $-2a$ $2a$ $-2a$ $2a$ $-2a$ $2a$ $-2a$  $\\Delta^2 P(x)$ $4a$ $-4a$ $4a$ $-4a$ $4a$ $-4a$  $\\vdots$  $\\Delta^7 P(x)$ $-2^7 a$   Thus we can read down the column for $x=1$ to find that $k! b_k = (-2)^k a$ for $k = 0, 1, \\ldots, 7$ .  Interestingly, even if we choose $P(x)$ to have degree greater than $7$ , the $8$ coefficients of lowest order always satisfy these conditions.  Moreover, it's straightforward to show that the $P(x)$ of degree $7$ with $b_k$ satisfying these conditions will fit the data given in the problem statement.  Thus, to find minimal necessary and sufficient conditions on the value of $a$ , we need only consider these $8$ equations.  As a result, $P(x)$ with integer coefficients fitting the given data exists iff $k!$ divides $2^k a$ for $k = 0, 1, \\ldots, 7$ .  In other words, it's necessary and sufficient that  $0! | a$ , $1! | 2a$ , $2! | 2^2 a$ , $3! | 2^3 a$ , $4! | 2^4 a$ , $5! | 2^5 a$ , $6! | 2^6 a$ , and $7! | 2^7 a$ .  The last condition holds if $7 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 3 = 315$ divides evenly into $a$ .  Since such $a$ will also satisfy the first $7$ conditions, our answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B)}\\ 315}$ .   2010 AMC 12B ( Problems • Answer Key • Resources )   Preceded by Problem 20   Followed by Problem 22    1  •  2  •  3  •  4  •  5  •  6  •  7  •  8  •  9  •  10  •  11  •  12  •  13  •  14  •  15  •  16  •  17  •  18  •  19  •  20  •  21  •  22  •  23  •  24  •  25    All AMC 12 Problems and Solutions    2010 AMC 10B ( Problems • Answer Key • Resources )   Preceded by Problem 24   Followed by Last Problem    1  •  2  •  3  •  4  •  5  •  6  •  7  •  8  •  9  •  10  •  11  •  12  •  13  •  14  •  15  •  16  •  17  •  18  •  19  •  20  •  21  •  22  •  23  •  24  •  25    All AMC 10 Problems and Solutions  The problems on this page are copyrighted by the Mathematical Association of America 's American Mathematics Competitions .

Notice that the roots of $P(x)$ are $a,b$ and the roots of $Q(x)$ are $c,d.$ Then we get: \\begin{align*} P(Q(x)) &= a, b \\\\ x^2 - (c+d)x + cd &= a, b \\end{align*} The two possible equations are then $x^2 - (c+d)x + cd-a=0$ and $x^2 - (c+d)x + cd-b=0$ . The solutions are $-23, -21, -17, -15$ . From Vieta's we know that the total sum $2(c+d) = -76 \\implies c+d = -38$ so the roots are paired $-23, -15$ and $-21, -17$ . Let $cd - a = 23*15$ and $cd - b = 21*17$ . We can similarly get that $ab - c = 59*49$ and $ab - d = 57*51$ , and $a+b = -108$ . Add the first two equations to get \\[2cd - (a+b) = 23*15 + 21*17 \\implies cd = \\frac{23*15+21*17 - 108}{2} = 297.\\] This means $Q(x) = x^2 + 38x + 297$ . Once more, we can similarly obtain \\[ab = \\frac{59*49 + 57*51 - 38}{2} = 2880.\\] Therefore $P(x) = x^2 + 108x + 2880$ . Now we can find the minimums to be \\[19^2 - 19*38 + 297 = -64\\] and \\[54^2 - 54*108 + 2880 = -36.\\] Summing, the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A)} -100}.$  ~Leonard_my_dude~ Let $P(x) = (x+a)(x+b)$ , $Q(x) = (x+c)(x+d)$ . $P(Q(x)) = (x^2 + cx + dx + cd + a)(x^2 + cx + dx + cd + b)$  $Q(P(x)) = (x^2 + ax + bx + ab + c)(x^2 + ax + bx + ab + d)$  Notice how the coefficient for $x$ has to be the same for the two quadratics that are multiplied to create $P(Q(x))$ , and $Q(P(x))$ . $P(Q(x)) = (x+ 23)(x+ 21)(x+ 17)(x+ 15) = (x^2 + 38x + 345)(x^2 + 38x + 357)$  $Q(P(x)) = (x+ 59)(x+ 57)(x+ 51)(x+ 49) = (x^2 + 108x + 2891)(x^2 + 108x + 2907)$   $c + d = 38$ , $cd + a = 345$ , $cd + b = 357$ , $a + b = 108$ , $ab + c = 2891$ , $ab + d = 2907$  $cd = \\frac{345 + 357 - 108}{2} = 297$ , $297 = 3^3 \\cdot 11$ , $c = 27$ , $d = 11$  $a = 345 - 27*11 = 48$ , $b = 357 - 27*11 = 60$   $P(x) = (x+48)(x+60) = x^2 + 108x + 2880 = (x+54)^2 - 36$  $Q(x) = (x+27)(x+11) = x^2 + 38x + 297 = (x+19)^2 -64$  $-36 -64 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(A) } -100}$ . ~ isabelchen  https://youtu.be/FPhaUQoRtPs  ~r00tsOfUnity\n",

The function intersects $1$ at some point from $x=-1$ to $x=0$ , and at some point from $x=0$ to $x=1$ , and at some point to the right of $x=1$ . The intervals where the function is greater than $1$ are between the points where the function equals $1$ and the vertical asymptotes.

      " Because 67 is the largest prime factor of 2010, it means that in the prime factorization of $\\prod_{n=2}^{5300}\\text{pow}(n)$ , there'll be $p_1 ^{e_1} \\cdot p_2 ^{e_2} \\cdot .... 67^x ...$ where $x$ is the desired value we are looking for. Thus, to find this answer, we need to look for the number of times $67$ is incorporated into the giant product. All numbers $n=67 \\cdot x$ , given $x = p_1 ^ {e_1} \\cdot p_2 ^{e_2} \\cdot ... \\cdot p_m ^ {e_m}$ such that for any integer $x$ between $1$ and $m$ , prime $p_x$ must be less than $67$ , contributes a 67 to the product. Considering $67 \\cdot 79 < 5300 < 67 \\cdot 80$ , the possible values of x are $1,2,...,70,72,74,...78$ , since $x=71,73,79$ are primes that are greater than 67. However, $\\text{pow}\\left(67^2\\right)$ contributes two $67$ s to the product, so we must count it twice. Therefore, the answer is $70 + 1 + 6 = \\boxed{77} \\Rightarrow \\boxed{D}$ . After finding the prime factorization of $2010=2\\cdot3\\cdot5\\cdot67$ , divide $5300$ by $67$ and add $5300$ divided by $67^2$ in order to find the total number of multiples of $67$ between $2$ and $5300$ . $\\lfloor\\frac{5300}{67}\\rfloor+\\lfloor\\frac{5300}{67^2}\\rfloor=80$ Since $71$ , $73$ , and $79$ are prime numbers greater than $67$ and less than or equal to $80$ , subtract $3$ from $80$ to get the answer $80-3=\\boxed{77}\\Rightarrow\\boxed{D}$ . How do we know that we only have to check 67? There is no solid relationship between 67 being the largest prime factor in 2010 and 67 giving the smallest result of 77. Ok, 67 is waaaay larger than any of the other prime factors of 2010. 2001's prime factors are close so there might be some ambiguity but if you can't see why given intervals of 67, 2s 3s and 5s don't need to be accounted for, you probably can't solve this problem .-..

      "When I solved it, I actually ended up trying 2, 3, and 5 just to be safe. It actually ends up not being that bad (since for each one, we only need to consider numbers that only have that prime and lower primes in its prime factorization, so you can just divide 5300 by your prime, find how many numbers less than that new number are only divisible by lower primes, divide by your prime again, and repeat). All said and done, it only ended up taking about 7-8 minutes of mental math (ran out of paper oops), and I think that reasonably speaking, many who are good enough to have a decent chance of solving this 25 can check 2, 3, and 5 on paper in 5 minutes.\n",

      " The total cost of the pencils can be found by $(\\text{students}\\cdot\\text{pencils purchased by each}\\cdot\\text{price of each pencil})$ . Since $1771$ is the product of three sets of values, we can begin with prime factorization, since it gives some insight into the values: $7, 11, 23$ . Since neither $(C)$ nor $(E)$ are any of these factors, they can be eliminated immediately, leaving $(A)$ , $(B)$ , and $(D)$ . Beginning with $(A) 7$ , we see that the number of pencils purchased by each student must be either $11$ or $23$ . However, the problem states that the price of each pencil must exceed the number of pencils purchased, so we can eliminate this. Continuing with $(B) 11$ , we can conclude that the only case that fulfils the restrictions are that there are $23$ students who each purchased $7$ such pencils, so the answer is $\\boxed{B}$ . We can apply the same logic to $(E)$ as we applied to $(A)$ if one wants to make doubly sure. We know the total cost of the pencils can be found by $(\\text{students}\\cdot\\text{pencils purchased by each}\\cdot\\text{price of each pencil})$ . Using prime factorization like in the solution above, we see that there is only one combination of three whole numbers whose product is equal to $1771$ : $7, 11, 23$ (without using $1$ ). So we know that $7, 11$ , and $23$ must be the number of students, the number of pencils purchased by each student and the price of each pencil in cents. We know that $23$ must be the number of students, as it is the only number that makes up the majority of 30. We pick the greater of the remaining numbers for the price of each pencil in cents, which is $11$ . Therefore, our answer is $\\boxed{B}$ . -JinhoK We let $s$ be the number of students that bought pencils at the bookstore, $c$ be the cost of each pencil in cents, and $n$ the number of pencils each student bought. Thus, we are looking for $c.$ Since a majority of the students in the class bought pencils at the bookstore, $s>\\dfrac{30}2=15.$ (s>15) We also know that $n>1$ and $c>n>1.$ Finally, $s\\cdot c\\cdot n=1771.$ We can factor $1771$ as $7\\cdot11\\cdot23.$ Since $n>15$ and $c>n>1,$ none of them can be $1,$ and therefore $c,n,$ and $s$ are $7,11,$ and $23$ in some order. We know that $n>15,$ so $n$ must be $23.$  $c>n,$ so $c=11$ and $n=7.$ Thus, $c=\\boxed{\\text{(B)}~11}$ cents.\n",

Thus, $15+10=\\boxed{25}$ or option $\\boxed{\\mathbf{(C )}25}$  ~SirAppel Notice that the period of the sequence is $3$ as given. (If this isn't clear we can show an example: $A+B+C=B+C=D$  $\\Leftrightarrow$  $A=D$ ). Then $A=D$ and $H=B$ , so $A+H=D+B=D+B+C-C=30-5=\\boxed{\\textbf{(C)}\\;25}$ . ~eevee9406 Something useful to shorten a lot of the solutions above is to notice \\[5 + D + E = D + E + F\\] so F = 5 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tlqpAcmbz4 ~Shreyas S https://www.buzzsprout.com/56982/episodes/383730 (Episode starts with a solution to this question)\n",

      " Solution 1 WLOG let the speed of the river be 0. This is allowed because the problem never states that the speed of the current has to have a magnitude greater than 0. In this case, when the powerboat travels from $A$ to $B$ , the raft remains at $A$ . Thus the trip from $A$ to $B$ takes the same time as the trip from $B$ to the raft. Since these times are equal and sum to $9$ hours, the trip from $A$ to $B$ must take half this time, or $4.5$ hours. The answer is thus $\\boxed{\\textbf{D}}$ . Remark: This is equivalent to viewing the problem from the raft's perspective. Solution 2 What's important in this problem is to consider everything in terms of the power boat and the raft, since that is how the problem is given to us. Think of the blue arrow as the power boat and the red arrow as the raft in the following three diagrams, which represent different time intervals of the problem. [asy] size(8cm,8cm); pair A, B; A=(-3,4); B=(3,4); draw(A--B); label(\"$A$\",A,S); label(\"$B$\",B,S); arrow((-2.5,6.4),dir(180),blue); arrow((-2.5,6.2),dir(180),red); pair A, B; A=(-3,5); B=(3,5); draw(A--B); label(\"$A$\",A,S); label(\"$B$\",B,S); arrow((2.6,5.4),dir(360),blue); arrow((-0.5,5.2),dir(180),red); pair A, B; A=(-3,6); B=(3,6); draw(A--B); label(\"$A$\",A,S); label(\"$B$\",B,S); arrow((.3,4.4),dir(360),blue); arrow((1.1,4.2),dir(180),red);[/asy]  Thinking about the distance covered as their distances with respect to each other, they are $0$ distance apart in the first diagram when they haven't started to move yet, some distance $d$ apart in the second diagram when the power boat reaches $B$ , and again $0$ distance apart in the third diagram when they meet. Therefore, with respect to each other, the boat and the raft cover a distance of $d$ on the way there, and again cover a distance of $d$ on when drawing closer. This makes sense, because from the 1st diagram to the second, the raft moves in the same direction as the boat, while from the 2nd to the 3rd, the boat and raft move in opposite directions. Let $b$ denote the speed of the power boat (only the power boat, not factoring in current) and $r$ denote the speed of the raft, which, as given by the problem, is also equal to the speed of the current. Thus, from $A$ to $B$ , the boat travels at a velocity of $b+r$ , and on the way back, travels at a velocity of $-(b-r)=r-b$ , since the current aids the boat on the way there, and goes against the boat on the way back. With respect to the raft then, the boat's velocity from $A$ to $B$ becomes $(r+b)-r=b$ , and on the way back it becomes $(r-b)-r=-b$ . Since the boat's velocities with respect to the raft are exact opposites, $b$ and $-b$ , we therefore know that the boat and raft travel apart from each other at the same rate that they travel toward each other. From this, we have that the boat travels a distance $d$ at rate $b$ with respect to the raft both on the way to $B$ and on the way back. Thus, using $\\dfrac{distance}{speed}=time$ , we have $\\dfrac{2d}{b}=9\\text{ hours}$ , and to see how long it took to travel half the distance, we have $\\dfrac{d}{b}=4.5\\text{ hours}\\implies\\boxed{\\textbf{D}}$  Solution 3 Let $t$ be the time it takes the power boat to go from $A$ to $B$ in hours, $r$ be the speed of the river current (and thus also the raft), and $p$ to be the speed of the power boat with respect to the river. Using $d = rt$ , the raft covers a distance of $9r$ , the distance from $A$ to $B$ is $(p + r)t$ , and the distance from $B$ to where the raft and power boat met up is $(9 - t)(p - r)$ . Then, $9r + (9 - t)(p - r) = (p + r)t$ . Solving for $t$ , we get $t = 4.5$ , which is $\\boxed{\\textbf{D}}$ . https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23iWcqbJlE ~Shreyas S fyi, this links to the wrong problem, it links to problem 11   2011 AMC 12A ( Problems • Answer Key • Resources )   Preceded by Problem 11   Followed by Problem 13    1  •  2  •  3  •  4  •  5  •  6  •  7  •  8  •  9  •  10  •  11  •  12  •  13  •  14  •  15  •  16  •  17  •  18  •  19  •  20  •  21  •  22  •  23  •  24  •  25    All AMC 12 Problems and Solutions  The problems on this page are copyrighted by the Mathematical Association of America 's American Mathematics Competitions .

Similarly, $NO = NC$ . The perimeter of $\\triangle{AMN}$ then becomes \\begin{align*} AM + MN + NA &= AM + MO + NO + NA \\\\ &= AM + MB + NC + NA \\\\ &= AB + AC \\\\ &= 30 \\rightarrow \\boxed{(B)} \\end{align*}  Let $O$ be the incenter. $AO$ is the angle bisector of $\\angle MAN$ . Let the angle bisector of $\\angle BAC$ meets $BC$ at $P$ and the angle bisector of $\\angle ABC$ meets $AC$ at $Q$ . By applying both angle bisector theorem and Menelaus' theorem,  $\\frac{AO}{OP} \\times \\frac{BP}{BC} \\times \\frac{CQ}{QA} = 1$   $\\frac{AO}{OP} \\times \\frac{12}{30} \\times \\frac{24}{12} = 1$   $\\frac{AO}{OP}=\\frac{5}{4}$   $\\frac{AO}{AP}=\\frac{5}{9}$  Perimeter of $\\triangle AMN = \\frac{12+24+18}{9} \\times 5 = 30  \\rightarrow \\boxed{(B)}$  Like in other solutions, let $O$ be the incenter of $\\triangle ABC$ . Let $AO$ intersect $BC$ at $D$ . By the angle bisector theorem, $\\frac{BD}{DC} = \\frac{AB}{AC} = \\frac{12}{18} = \\frac{2}{3}$ . Since $BD+DC = 24$ , we have $\\frac{BD}{24-BD} = \\frac{2}{3}$ , so $3BD = 48 - 2BD$ , so $BD = \\frac{48}{5} = 9.6$ . By the angle bisector theorem on $\\triangle ABD$ , we have $\\frac{DO}{OA} = \\frac{BD}{BA} = \\frac{4}{5} = 0.8$ , so $\\frac{DA}{OA} = 1 + \\frac{DO}{OA} = \\frac{9}{5} = 1.8$ , so $\\frac{AO}{AD} = \\frac{5}{9}$ . Because $\\triangle AMN \\sim \\triangle ABC$ , the perimeter of $\\triangle AMN$ must be $\\frac{5}{9} (12 + 18 + 24) = 30$ , so our answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B)}\\ 30}$ . Another way to find $\\frac{AO}{OD}$ is to use mass points. Assign a mass of 24 to $A$ , a mass of 18 to $B$ , and a mass of 12 to $C$ . Then $D$ has mass 30, so $\\frac{AO}{OD} = \\frac{30}{24} = \\frac{5}{4} = 1.25$ . We know that the ratio of the perimeter of $\\triangle AMN$ and $\\triangle ABC$ is the ratio of their heights, and finding the two heights is pretty easy. Note that the height from $A$ to $BC$ is $\\frac{9\\sqrt{15}}{4}$ from Herons and then $A=\\frac{bh}{2}$ and also that the height from $A$ to $MN$ is simply the height from $A$ to $BC$ minus the inradius. We know the area and the semiperimeter so $r=\\frac{A}{s}$ which gives us $r=\\sqrt{15}$ . Now we know that the altitude from $A$ to $MN$ is $\\frac{5\\sqrt{15}}{4}$ so the ratios of the heights from $A$ for $\\triangle AMN$ and $\\triangle ABC$ is $\\frac{5}{9}$ . Thus the perimeter of $\\triangle AMN$ is $\\frac{5}{9} \\times 54 = 30$ so our answer is $\\boxed{B}$  -srisainandan6 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u23iWcqbJlE ~Shreyas S https://youtu.be/5jwD5UViZO8?t=1013  ~ pi_is_3.14   2011 AMC 12A ( Problems • Answer Key • Resources )   Preceded by Problem 12   Followed by Problem 14    1  •  2  •  3  •  4  •  5  •  6  •  7  •  8  •  9  •  10  •  11  •  12  •  13  •  14  •  15  •  16  •  17  •  18  •  19  •  20  •  21  •  22  •  23  •  24  •  25    All AMC 12 Problems and Solutions  The problems on this page are copyrighted by the Mathematical Association of America 's American Mathematics Competitions .

      " If $(a,b)$ lies above the parabola, then $b$ must be greater than $y(a)$ . We thus get the inequality $b>a^3-ba$ . Solving this for $b$ gives us $b>\\frac{a^3}{a+1}$ . Now note that $\\frac{a^3}{a+1}$ constantly increases when $a$ is positive. Then since this expression is greater than $9$ when $a=4$ , we can deduce that $a$ must be less than $4$ in order for the inequality to hold, since otherwise $b$ would be greater than $9$ and not a single-digit integer. The only possibilities for $a$ are thus $1$ , $2$ , and $3$ . For $a=1$ , we get $b>\\frac{1}{2}$ for our inequality, and thus $b$ can be any integer from $1$ to $9$ .

Our answer is $C$ ! Right off the bat, we can analyze three things: 1.) There can only be two of the same color on the pentagon. 2.) Any pair of the same color can only be next to each other on the pentagon. 3.) There can only be two different pairs of same colors on the pentagon at once. Now that we know this, we can solve the problem by using three cases: no same color pairs,  one same color pair, and two same color pairs. 1.) If there are no color pairs, it is a simple permutation: six different colors in five different spots. We count $6!=720$ cases. No rotation is necessary because all permutations are accounted for. 2.)If there is one color pair, we must count 6 possibilities for the pair(as one element), 5 for the third vertex, 4 for the fourth vertex, and 3 for the fifth vertex. We get $6\\times5\\times4\\times3=360$ . However, there are 5 different locations the pair could be at. Therefore we get $360\\times5=1800$ possibilities for one pair. 3.)If there are two color pairs, we must count 6 possibilities for the first pair(as one element), 5 possibilities for the next pair(as one element), and 4 possibilities for the final vertex. We get $6\\times5\\times4=120$ . Once again, there are 5 different rotations in the pentagon that we must account for. Therefore we get $120\\times5=600$ possibilities for two pairs. 5.) If we add all of three cases together, we get $720+1800+600=3120$ . The answer is $C$ . Solution by gsaelite This solution essentially explains other ways of thinking about the cases stated in Solution 2. Case 1: ${6\\choose5} \\cdot 5!$  5 colors need to be chosen from the group of 6. Those 5 colors have 5! distinct arrangements on the pentagon's vertices. Case 2: ${6\\choose4} \\cdot4\\cdot5\\cdot3!$  4 colors need to be chosen from the group of 6. Out of those 4 colors, one needs to be chosen to form a pair of 2 identical colors. Then, for arranging this layout onto the pentagon, one of the five sides (same thing as pair of adjacent vertices) of the pentagon needs to be established for the pair. The remaining 3 unique colors can be arranged 3! different ways on the remaining 3 vertices. Case 3: ${6\\choose3} \\cdot {3\\choose2} \\cdot5\\cdot2$  3 colors need to be chosen from the group of 6. Out of those 3 colors, 2 need to be chosen to be the pairs. Then, for arranging this layout onto the pentagon, start out by thinking about the 1 color that is not part of a pair, as it makes things easier. It can be any one of the 5 vertices of the pentagon. The remaining 2 pairs of colors can only be arranged 2 ways on the remaining 4 vertices. Solving each case and adding them up gets you 3120. $\\boxed{C}$  https://youtu.be/FThly7dRBIE  ~IceMatrix We can order the vertices of pentagon $ABCDE$ arbitrarily. This means that besides for the first and last vertices, the previous vertex and the next vertex of any vertex have diagonals (such as $A$ , $C$ , $E$ , $B$ , $D$ where $C$ shares diagonals with $A$ and $E$ , $E$ shares diagonals with $C$ and $B$ , etc.). The first point can be one of $6$ colors as we have no designated restraints on it. From there, the next three points can be five colors each since the only color restraint is that of the previous color (i.e. if the first point was blue, then the next point can be any of the other $5$ colors, such as purple, and the point after that can be any color except purple, which is 5 colors). The last point is the trickiest because we need to consider the second to last vertex and the first vertex. The third vertex has a $\\frac{1}{5}$ chance of being the same color as the first vertex, guaranteeing that the second to last vertex is a different color from the first vertex, leaving the last vertex with $4$ possible colors. The remaining $\\frac{4}{5}$ times where the third to last vertex is a different color from the first vertex, there is a $\\frac{4}{5}$ chance that the second to last vertex is a different color from the first vertex and a $\\frac{1}{5}$ chance that they are the same color, so there are $4$ and $5$ possibilities for the last vertex respectively. Our answer is now $6\\times5^3\\times(\\frac{4}{5}\\times(\\frac{4}{5}\\times4+\\frac{1}{5}\\times5)+\\frac{1}{5}\\times4)=3120$ , which is $\\boxed{C}$ . ~Randomlygenerated Start at an arbitrary vertex (call this $A_1$ ) and draw a \"star\" by connecting the vertices at each of the $5$ diagonals of the pentagon. For each vertex you visit when you're drawing the star, label those successively as $A_2, A_3, A_4,$ and $A_5.$ Let the $6$ colors be the numbers $1, 2, ..., 6$ for simplicity. Then, this problem basically boils down to finding the number of sequences $A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4, A_5$ such that (1) $1 \\leq A_i \\leq 6$ for each $1 \\leq i \\leq 6,$ (2) no two adjacent terms are equal, and (3) $A_1 \\neq A_5.$  Observe that the number of such sequences satisfying conditions (1) and (2) is $N = 6 \\cdot 5^4.$ (since $A_1$ can be freely chosen, while there are only $5$ choices for each of $A_2, ..., A_5$ because none of those can be equal to the previous term) To find the number of sequences satisfying all three conditions, we can use complimentary counting and subtract the number of sequences $M$ that satisfy (1) and (2) but NOT (3) from $N.$  In other words, we're looking for the sequences with $A_1 = A_5$ that satisfy (1) and (2). Fix $A_1 = A_5 = X,$ where $X \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}.$  For each value of $X,$ there are three possible forms of the sequence: $\\bullet$  $X A B C X,$ where $A, B, C$ are distinct from $X$ and $A, B, C$ themselves are also distinct. \n",
      "There are $5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 = 60$ ways to assign the values of $A, B, C$ in this case. $\\bullet$  $X A B A X,$ where $A$ and $B$ are distinct from $X$ and $A$ and $B$ themselves are also distinct. \n",

There are $5^2 = 25$ ways to assign the values of $y_1$ and $y_2$ in this case. Thus, for each value of $X,$ there are $60 + 20 + 25 = 105$ possible such sequences. Since $X$ can be arbitrarily chosen, we obtain that $M = 6 \\cdot 105 = 630.$ Thus, our final answer, the number of sequences satisfying conditions (1), (2), and (3) is $6 \\cdot 5^4 - 630 = \\boxed{3120}.$  -fidgetboss_4000   2011 AMC 12A ( Problems • Answer Key • Resources )   Preceded by Problem 15   Followed by Problem 17    1  •  2  •  3  •  4  •  5  •  6  •  7  •  8  •  9  •  10  •  11  •  12  •  13  •  14  •  15  •  16  •  17  •  18  •  19  •  20  •  21  •  22  •  23  •  24  •  25    All AMC 12 Problems and Solutions  The problems on this page are copyrighted by the Mathematical Association of America 's American Mathematics Competitions .

      " Plugging in some values, we see that the  graph of the equation $|x+y|+|x-y| = 2$ is a square bounded by $x= \\pm 1$ and $y = \\pm 1$ . Notice that $x^2 - 6x + y^2 = (x-3)^2 + y^2 - 9$ means the square of the distance from a point $(x,y)$ to point $(3,0)$ minus 9. To maximize that value, we need to choose the point in the feasible region farthest from point $(3,0)$ , which is $(-1, \\pm 1)$ . Either one, when substituting into the function, yields $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D)}\\ 8}$ . Since the equation $|x+y|+|x-y| = 2$ is dealing with absolute values, the following could be deduced: $(x+y)+(x-y)=2$ , $(x+y)-(x-y)=2$ , $-(x+y)+(x-y)=2$ , and $-(x+y)-(x-y)=2$ . Simplifying would give $x=1$ , $y=1$ , $y=-1$ , and $x=-1$ . In $x^2-6x+y^2$ , we care most about $-6x,$ since both $x^2$ and $y^2$ are non-negative. To maximize $-6x$ , though, $x$ would have to be -1.

      " We start with $2^{1+\\lfloor\\log_{2}(N-1)\\rfloor}-N = 19$ . After rearranging, we get $\\lfloor\\log_{2}(N-1)\\rfloor = \\log_{2} \\left(\\frac{N+19}{2}\\right)$ . Since $\\lfloor\\log_{2}(N-1)\\rfloor$ is a positive integer, $\\frac{N+19}{2}$ must be in the form of $2^{m}$ for some positive integer $m$ . From this fact, we get $N=2^{m+1}-19$ . If we now check integer values of N that satisfy this condition, starting from $N=19$ , we quickly see that the first values that work for $N$ are $45$ and $109$ , that is, $2^6-19$ and $2^7 -19$ , giving values of $5$ and $6$ for $m$ , respectively. Adding up these two values for $N$ , we get $45 + 109 = 154 \\rightarrow \\boxed{\\textbf{C}}$  We examine the value that $2^{1+\\lfloor\\log_{2}(N-1)\\rfloor}$ takes over various intervals. The $\\lfloor\\log_{2}(N-1)\\rfloor$ means it changes on each multiple of 2, like so: 2 --> 1 3 - 4 --> 2 5 - 8 --> 3 9 - 16 --> 4 From this, we see that $2^{1+\\lfloor\\log_{2}(N-1)\\rfloor} - N$ is the difference between the next power of 2 above $2^{\\lfloor\\log_{2}(N-1)\\rfloor}$ and $N$ . We are looking for $N$ such that this difference is 19. The first two $N$ that satisfy this are $45 = 64-19$ and $109=128-19$ for a final answer of $45 + 109 = 154 \\rightarrow \\boxed{\\textbf{C}}$    Note that each $N$ is $19$ less than a power of $2$ . So, the answer will be $38$ less than the sum of $2$ powers of $2$ . Adding $38$ to each answer, we get $76$ , $128$ , $192$ , $444$ , and $1062$ . Obviously we can take out $76$ and $1062$ . Also, $128$ will not work because two powers of two will never sum to another power of $2$ (unless they are equal, which is a contradiction to the question). So, we have $192$ and $444$ . Note that $444 = 1 + 443 = 2 + 442 = 4 + 440 = 8 + 436 = 16 + 428 = 32 + 412$ , etc. We quickly see that $444$ will not work, leaving $192$ which corresponds to $\\boxed{\\textbf{C}}$ . We can also confirm that this works because $192 = 128 + 64 = 2^7 + 2^6$ . In order to fix the exponent and get rid of the logarithm term, let $N = 2^m + k + 1$ , with $0 \\leq k < 2^m$ . Doing so, we see that $\\lfloor \\log_2{N - 1} \\rfloor = m$ , which turns our given relation into \\[2^m = 20 + k,\\] for which the solutions of the form $(m, k)$ , $(5, 12)$ and $(6, 44)$ , follow trivially. Adding up the two values of $N$ gives us $32 + 12 + 1 + 64 + 44 + 1 = 154$ , so the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{C}}$ .   2011 AMC 12A ( Problems • Answer Key • Resources )   Preceded by Problem 18   Followed by Problem 20    1  •  2  •  3  •  4  •  5  •  6  •  7  •  8  •  9  •  10  •  11  •  12  •  13  •  14  •  15  •  16  •  17  •  18  •  19  •  20  •  21  •  22  •  23  •  24  •  25    All AMC 12 Problems and Solutions  The problems on this page are copyrighted by the Mathematical Association of America 's American Mathematics Competitions .

Similarly, from the second inequality, we get $70 < 64a+8b+c < 80$ . Again subtracting $a+b+c = 0$ from this gives us $70 < 63a+7b < 80$ , or $10 < 9a+b < \\frac{80}{7}$ .

      " There must be four rays emanating from $X$ that intersect the four corners of the square region. Depending on the location of $X$ , the number of rays distributed among these four triangular sectors will vary. We start by finding the corner-most point that is $100$ -ray partitional (let this point be the bottom-left-most point). We first draw the four rays that intersect the vertices. At this point, the triangular sectors with bases as the sides of the square that the point is closest to both do not have rays dividing their areas. Therefore, their heights are equivalent since their areas are equal. The remaining $96$ rays are divided among the other two triangular sectors, each sector with $48$ rays, thus dividing these two sectors into $49$ triangles of equal areas. Let the distance from this corner point to the closest side be $a$ and the side of the square be $s$ . From this, we get the equation $\\frac{a\\times s}{2}=\\frac{(s-a)\\times s}{2}\\times\\frac1{49}$ . Solve for $a$ to get $a=\\frac s{50}$ . Therefore, point $X$ is $\\frac1{50}$ of the side length away from the two sides it is closest to. By moving $X$  $\\frac s{50}$ to the right, we also move one ray from the right sector to the left sector, which determines another $100$ -ray partitional point. We can continue moving $X$ right and up to derive the set of points that are $100$ -ray partitional. In the end, we get a square grid of points each $\\frac s{50}$ apart from one another. Since this grid ranges from a distance of $\\frac s{50}$ from one side to $\\frac{49s}{50}$ from the same side, we have a $49\\times49$ grid, a total of $2401$  $100$ -ray partitional points. To find the overlap from the $60$ -ray partitional, we must find the distance from the corner-most $60$ -ray partitional point to the sides closest to it. Since the $100$ -ray partitional points form a $49\\times49$ grid, each point $\\frac s{50}$ apart from each other, we can deduce that the $60$ -ray partitional points form a $29\\times29$ grid, each point $\\frac s{30}$ apart from each other. To find the overlap points, we must find the common divisors of $30$ and $50$ which are $1, 2, 5,$ and $10$ . Therefore, the overlapping points will form grids with points $s$ , $\\frac s{2}$ , $\\frac s{5}$ , and $\\frac s{10}$ away from each other respectively. Since the grid with points $\\frac s{10}$ away from each other includes the other points, we can disregard the other grids. The total overlapping set of points is a $9\\times9$ grid, which has $81$ points. Subtract $81$ from $2401$ to get $2401-81=\\boxed{\\textbf{(C)}\\ 2320}$ . Position the square region $R$ so that the bottom-left corner of the square is at the origin. Then define $s$ to be the sidelength of $R$ and $X$ to be the point $(rs, qs)$ , where $0<r,q<1$ . There must be four rays emanating from $X$ that intersect the four corners of $R$ . The areas of the four triangles formed by these rays are then $A_1=\\frac{qs\\times s}{2}$ , $A_2=\\frac{(s-rs)\\times s}{2}$ , $A_3=\\frac{(s-qs)\\times s}{2}$ , and $A_4=\\frac{rs\\times s}{2}$ . If a point is $n$ -ray partitional, then there exist positive integers $a, b, c, d$ such that $a+b+c+d=n$ and $\\frac{A_1}{a}=\\frac{A_2}{b}=\\frac{A_3}{c}=\\frac{A_4}{d}$ . Substituting in our formulas for $A_1$ , $A_2$ , $A_3$ , and $A_4$ and canceling equal terms, we get \\[\\frac{q}{a}=\\frac{1-r}{b}=\\frac{1-q}{c}=\\frac{r}{d}.\\]  Taking $\\frac{q}{a}=\\frac{1-q}{c}$ and solving for $q$ , we get $q=\\frac{a}{a+c}$ , and taking $\\frac{1-r}{b}=\\frac{r}{d}$ and solving for $r$ , we get $r=\\frac{d}{b+d}$ . Finally, from $\\frac{q}{a}=\\frac{r}{d}$ , we have $qd=ar$  $\\Leftrightarrow$  $\\frac{ad}{a+c}=\\frac{ad}{b+d}$  $\\Leftrightarrow$  $a+c=b+d$ . So for a point $X$ to be $100$ -ray partitional, $a+b+c+d=100$ , so $a+c=b+d=50$ . $X$ must then be of the form $\\left(\\frac{d}{50}s, \\frac{a}{50}s\\right)$ . Since $X$ is in the interior of $R$ , $a$ and $d$ can be any positive integer from $1$ to $49$ (with $b$ and $c$ just equaling $50-d$ and $50-a$ , respectively). Thus, there are $49\\times 49=2401$ points that are $100$ -ray partitional. However, the problem asks for points that are not only $100$ -ray partitional but also not $60$ -ray partitional. Points that are $60$ -ray partitional are of the form $\\left(\\frac{m}{30}s, \\frac{n}{30}s\\right)$ , where $m$ and $n$ are also positive integers. We count the number of points $\\left(\\frac{d}{50}s, \\frac{a}{50}s\\right)$ that can also be written in this form. For a given $d$ , $\\frac{d}{50}=\\frac{m}{30}$ if and only if $m=\\frac{3}{5}d$ , and likewise with $a$ and $n$ . We can then see that a point is both $100$ -ray partitional and $60$ -ray partitional if and only if $a$ and $d$ are both divisible by $5$ . There are $9$ integers between $1$ and $49$ that are divisible by $5$ , so out of our $2401$ points that are $100$ -ray partitional, $9\\times 9=81$ are also $60$ -ray partitional. Our answer then is just $2401-81=\\boxed{\\textbf{(C)}\\ 2320}$ . For the sake of simplicity, let $R$ be a $60 \\times 60$ square and set the bottom-left point as the origin. Then, $R$ has vertices: \\[(0,0), (60,0), (60,60), (0,60).\\]  Now, let a point in the square have coordinates $(x, y).$  In order for the point to be $100-$ ray partitional, we must be able to make $100$ triangles with area $60^2/100 = 36.$ For it to not be $60$ -ray partitional, we cannot make $60$ triangles with area $60^2/60 = 60.$  When we draw such a triangle, it's base will always be on one of the sides of the square. If it is on the bottom side, then the height must be $y$ . So, the base of each triangle must be $\\frac{72}{y}.$ So, there will be $\\frac{60}{\\frac{72}{y}} = \\frac{60y}{72}$ total triangles on that side. If the triangle is on the right side of the square, then the height has to be $60 - x.$ So, the base will be $\\frac{72}{60-x}$ and there will be $\\frac{60 (60-x)}{72}$ triangles. If the triangle is on the top, the height will be $60-y$ , the base will be $\\frac{72}{60-y}$ and there will be $\\frac{60 (60-y)}{72}$ triangles along this side. The triangles on the left will have height $x$ , base $\\frac{72}{x}$ and $\\frac{60x}{72}$ such triangles must exist. Simplifying, we get $\\frac{5y}{6}, \\frac{5 (60-x)}{6}, \\frac{5(60-y)}{6}, \\frac{5x}{6}$ triangles on the respective sides of the square. All of these numbers must be integers. Let $x = 60a$ and $y = 60b$ where $0 < a, b < 1.$  Then, the amounts become: \\[50a, 50b,  50 - 50a, 50 - 50b.\\]  As long as $50a$ and $50b$ are integers, $50 - 50a$ and $50 - 50b$ will also be integers. For this to happen, $a$ and $b$ must be of the form $\\frac{x}{50}$ where $1 \\le x \\le 49.$ So, we have a total of $49^2 = 2401$ points that are $100$ -ray partitional. Now, we must calculate the number of $100$ - ray partitional points that are also $60$ -ray partitional. Using a method similar to before, if a point is $60$ -ray partitional, then we must be able to make $30a, 30b, 30 - 30a, 30 -30b$ triangles on the different sides. So, $30a$ and $30b$ must be integers. This means $a$ and $b$ have to be of the form $\\frac{y}{30}$ where $0<y<30.$  If a point is both $100$ -ray partitional and $60$ -ray partitional, then it can be written as \\[\\frac{x}{50} =  \\frac{y}{30}\\] . Note that whenever $x$ is divisible by $5$ , a $y$ will always exist to satisfy the above equation. So, $x$ has to be in the range $(0, 50)$ and must be divisible by $5$ . There are $9$ possibilities, namely $5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45.$  The $x$ -coordinate of the point and the $y$ -coordinate of the point can each use any of these $9$ possibilities, giving $9^2 = 81$ numbers that are both $100$ -ray partitional and $60$ -ray partitional. Overall, we are left with $2401 - 81 = \\boxed{2320}$ solutions. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpoFyHaLRh4    2011 AMC 12A ( Problems • Answer Key • Resources )   Preceded by Problem 21   Followed by Problem 23    1  •  2  •  3  •  4  •  5  •  6  •  7  •  8  •  9  •  10  •  11  •  12  •  13  •  14  •  15  •  16  •  17  •  18  •  19  •  20  •  21  •  22  •  23  •  24  •  25    All AMC 12 Problems and Solutions    2011 AMC 10A ( Problems • Answer Key • Resources )   Preceded by Problem 24   Followed by Last Problem    1  •  2  •  3  •  4  •  5  •  6  •  7  •  8  •  9  •  10  •  11  •  12  •  13  •  14  •  15  •  16  •  17  •  18  •  19  •  20  •  21  •  22  •  23  •  24  •  25    All AMC 10 Problems and Solutions  The problems on this page are copyrighted by the Mathematical Association of America 's American Mathematics Competitions .

      " By algebraic manipulations, we obtain \\[h(z)=g(g(z))=f(f(f(f(z))))=\\frac{Pz+Q}{Rz+S}\\] where \\[P=(a+1)^2+a(b+1)^2\\]  \\[Q=a(b+1)(b^2+2a+1)\\]  \\[R=(b+1)(b^2+2a+1)\\]  \\[S=a(b+1)^2+(a+b^2)^2\\] In order for $h(z)=z$ , we must have $R=0$ , $Q=0$ , and $P=S$ . $R=0$ implies $b=-1$ or $b^2+2a+1=0$ . $Q=0$ implies $a=0$ , $b=-1$ , or $b^2+2a+1=0$ . $P=S$ implies $b=\\pm1$ or $b^2+2a+1=0$ . Since $|a|=1\\neq 0$ , in order to satisfy all 3 conditions we must have either $b=\\pm1$ or $b^2+2a+1=0$ . In the first case $|b|=1$ . For the latter case note that \\[|b^2+1|=|-2a|=2\\]  \\[2=|b^2+1|\\leq |b^2|+1\\] and hence, \\[1\\leq|b|^2\\Rightarrow1\\leq |b|\\] . \n",
      "On the other hand, \\[2=|b^2+1|\\geq|b^2|-1\\] so, \\[|b^2|\\leq 3\\Rightarrow0\\leq |b|\\leq \\sqrt{3}\\] . Thus $1\\leq |b|\\leq \\sqrt{3}$ . Hence the maximum value for $|b|$ is $\\sqrt{3}$ while the minimum is $1$ (which can be achieved for instance when $|a|=1,|b|=\\sqrt{3}$ or $|a|=1,|b|=1$ respectively). Therefore the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C)}\\ \\sqrt{3}-1}$ . We only need $Q$ in $f^4(z)=g^2(z)=\\frac{Pz+\\textcolor{red}{Q}}{Rz+S}$ . Set $Q=0$ : $a(b+1)\\left(b^2+2a+1\\right)=0$ . Since $|a|=1$ , either $b+1=0$ or $b^2+2a+1=0$ . $b+1=0\\rightarrow b=-1$ so $|b|=1$ . $b^2+2a+1=0\\rightarrow b^2=-1-2a$ . This is a circle in the complex plane centered at $(-1,0)$ with radius $2$ since $|a|=1$ . The maximum distance from the origin is $3$ at $(-3,0)$ and similarly the minimum distance is $1$ at $(1,0)$ . So $1\\le |b^2|\\le 3\\rightarrow 1\\le |b|\\le \\sqrt{3}$ . Both solutions give the same lower bound, $1$ . So the range is $\\sqrt{3}-1=\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }\\sqrt{3}-1}$ .  https://youtu.be/FU18x_LsTeQ  ~MathProblemSolvingSkills.com This problem is kinda similar to 2002 AIME I Problems/Problem 12    2011 AMC 12A ( Problems • Answer Key • Resources )   Preceded by Problem 22   Followed by Problem 24    1  •  2  •  3  •  4  •  5  •  6  •  7  •  8  •  9  •  10  •  11  •  12  •  13  •  14  •  15  •  16  •  17  •  18  •  19  •  20  •  21  •  22  •  23  •  24  •  25    All AMC 12 Problems and Solutions  The problems on this page are copyrighted by the Mathematical Association of America 's American Mathematics Competitions .

      " Note as above that ABCD must be tangential to obtain the circle with maximal radius. Let $E$ , $F$ , $G$ , and $H$ be the points on $AB$ , $BC$ , $CD$ , and $DA$ respectively where the circle is tangent. Let $\\theta=\\angle BAD$ and $\\alpha=\\angle ADC$ . Since the quadrilateral is cyclic(because we want to maximize the circle, so we set the quadrilateral to be cyclic), $\\angle ABC=180^{\\circ}-\\alpha$ and $\\angle BCD=180^{\\circ}-\\theta$ . Let the circle have center $O$ and radius $r$ . Note that $OHD$ , $OGC$ , $OFB$ , and $OEA$ are right angles. Hence $FOG=\\theta$ , $GOH=180^{\\circ}-\\alpha$ , $EOH=180^{\\circ}-\\theta$ , and $FOE=\\alpha$ . Therefore, $AEOH\\sim OFCG$ and $EBFO\\sim HOGD$ . Let $x=CG$ . Then $CF=x$ , $BF=BE=9-x$ , $GD=DH=7-x$ , and $AH=AE=x+5$ . Using $AEOH\\sim OFCG$ and $EBFO\\sim HOGD$ we have $r/(x+5)=x/r$ , and $(9-x)/r=r/(7-x)$ . By equating the value of $r^2$ from each, $x(x+5)=(7-x)(9-x)$ . Solving we obtain $x=3$ so that $r=\\boxed{\\textbf{(C)}\\ 2\\sqrt{6}}$ . To maximize the radius of the circle, we also need to maximize its area. To maximize the area of the circle, the quadrilateral must be tangential (have an incircle). In a tangential quadrilateral, the sum of opposite sides is equal to the semiperimeter of the quadrilateral. $14+7=12+9$ , so this particular quadrilateral has an incircle. By definition, given $4$ side lengths, a cyclic quadrilateral has the maximum area of any quadrilateral with those side lengths. Therefore, to maximize the area of the quadrilateral and thus the incircle, we assume that this quadrilateral is cyclic. For cyclic quadrilaterals, Brahmagupta's formula gives the area as $\\sqrt{(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)(s-d)}$ where $s$ is the semiperimeter and $a, b, c,$ and $d$ are the side lengths. Breaking it up into $4$ triangles, we see the area of a tangential quadrilateral is also equal to $r*s$ . Equate these two equations.\n",
      "Substituting $s$ , the semiperimeter, and $A$ , the area and solving for $r$ ,we get $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C)}\\ 2\\sqrt{6}}$ . By Pitot's Theorem, since $AB+CD=AD+BC$ , there exists a circle tangent to all four sides of quadrilateral $ABCD$ . Thus, we need to find the radius of this circle. Let the circle be tangent to $AB$ , $BC$ , $CD$ , and $AD$ at points $P$ , $Q$ , $R$ , and $S$ , respectively. Also, let $AP=x$ . Then $AS$ also equals $x$ . Let the center of the circle be $O$ . Observe that $AO$ bisects angle $\\angle A$ , so $\\cot\\frac{A}{2}=\\frac{x}{r}$ . Moreover, $\\cot\\frac{C}{2}=\\frac{9-(14-x)}{r}=\\frac{x-5}{r}$ . But $\\angle \\frac{C}{2}=90^\\circ-\\angle \\frac{A}{2}$ , so $\\cot\\frac{C}{2}=\\tan\\frac{A}{2}$ , and we find that $\\frac{r}{x}=\\frac{x-5}{r}$ . Hence, $r^2=x(x-5)$ . Similarly, $\\cot\\frac{B}{2}=\\frac{14-x}{r}$ , and $\\cot\\frac{D}{2}=\\frac{12-x}{r}=\\tan\\frac{B}{2}=\\frac{r}{14-x}$ . Therefore, $r^2=\\frac{12-x}{14-x}$ . Putting this together with the above equation yields \\[(12-x)(14-x)=x(x-5)\\] \\[\\Longrightarrow x^2-26x+168=x^2-5x\\] \\[\\Longrightarrow 21x=168\\] \\[\\Longrightarrow x=8.\\] Thus, $r^2=8(8-5)=8(3)=24$ , and $r=\\boxed{\\textbf{(C)}\\ 2\\sqrt{6}}$ .   2011 AMC 12A ( Problems • Answer Key • Resources )   Preceded by Problem 23   Followed by Problem 25    1  •  2  •  3  •  4  •  5  •  6  •  7  •  8  •  9  •  10  •  11  •  12  •  13  •  14  •  15  •  16  •  17  •  18  •  19  •  20  •  21  •  22  •  23  •  24  •  25    All AMC 12 Problems and Solutions  The problems on this page are copyrighted by the Mathematical Association of America 's American Mathematics Competitions .

      " Let $\\angle CAB=A$ , $\\angle ABC=B$ , $\\angle BCA=C$ for convenience. It's well-known that $\\angle BOC=2A$ , $\\angle BIC=90+\\frac{A}{2}$ , and $\\angle BHC=180-A$ (verifiable by angle chasing). Then, as $A=60$ , it follows that $\\angle BOC=\\angle BIC=\\angle BHC=120$ and consequently pentagon $BCOIH$ is cyclic. Observe that $BC=1$ is fixed, hence the circumcircle of cyclic pentagon $BCOIH$ is also fixed. Similarly, as $OB=OC$ (both are radii), it follows that $O$ and also $[BCO]$ is fixed. Since $[BCOIH]=[BCO]+[BOIH]$ is maximal, it suffices to maximize $[BOIH]$ . Verify that $\\angle IBC=\\frac{B}{2}$ , $\\angle HBC=90-C$ by angle chasing; it follows that $\\angle IBH=\\angle HBC-\\angle IBC=90-C-\\frac{B}{2}=\\frac{A}{2}-\\frac{C}{2}=30-\\frac{C}{2}$ since $A+B+C=180\\implies\\frac{A}{2}+\\frac{B}{2}+\\frac{C}{2}=90$ by Triangle Angle Sum. Similarly, $\\angle OBC=(180-120)/2=30$ (isosceles base angles are equal), hence \\[\\angle IBO=\\angle IBC-\\angle OBC=\\frac{B}{2}-30=60-\\frac{A}{2}-\\frac{C}{2}=30-\\frac{C}{2}\\] Since $\\angle IBH=\\angle IBO$ , $IH=IO$ by Inscribed Angles. There are two ways to proceed. Letting $O'$ and $R$ be the circumcenter and circumradius, respectively, of cyclic pentagon $BCOIH$ , the most straightforward is to write $[BOIH]=[OO'I]+[IO'H]+[HO'B]-[BO'O]$ , whence \\[[BOIH]=\\frac{1}{2}R^2(\\sin(60-C)+\\sin(60-C)+\\sin(2C-60)-\\sin(60))\\] and, using the fact that $R$ is fixed, maximize $2\\sin(60-C)+\\sin(2C-60)$ with Jensen's Inequality. A more elegant way is shown below. Lemma:  $[BOIH]$ is maximized only if $HB=HI$ . Proof by contradiction: Suppose $[BOIH]$ is maximized when $HB\\neq HI$ . Let $H'$ be the midpoint of minor arc $BI$ be and $I'$ the midpoint of minor arc $H'O$ . Then $[BOIH']=[IBO]+[IBH']>[IBO]+[IBH]=[BOIH]$ since the altitude from $H'$ to $BI$ is greater than that from $H$ to $BI$ ; similarly $[BH'I'O]>[BOIH']>[BOIH]$ . Taking $H'$ , $I'$ to be the new orthocenter, incenter, respectively, this contradicts the maximality of $[BOIH]$ , so our claim follows. $\\blacksquare$  With our lemma( $HB=HI$ ) and $IH=IO$ from above, along with the fact that inscribed angles that intersect the same length chords are equal, \\[\\angle ABC=2\\angle IBC=2(\\angle OBC+\\angle OBI)=2(30+\\frac{1}{3}\\angle OCB)=80\\implies\\boxed{(D)}\\]  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3amRG9zEHE&ab_channel=OsmanNal    2011 AMC 12A ( Problems • Answer Key • Resources )   Preceded by Problem 24   Followed by Last Problem    1  •  2  •  3  •  4  •  5  •  6  •  7  •  8  •  9  •  10  •  11  •  12  •  13  •  14  •  15  •  16  •  17  •  18  •  19  •  20  •  21  •  22  •  23  •  24  •  25    All AMC 12 Problems and Solutions  The problems on this page are copyrighted by the Mathematical Association of America 's American Mathematics Competitions .

      " In order to solve this problem, use of the tangent-tangent intersection theorem (Angle of intersection between two tangents dividing a circle into arc length A and arc length B = 1/2 (Arc A° - Arc B°). In order to utilize this theorem, the degree measures of the arcs must be found.  First, set A (Arc length A) equal to 3d, and B (Arc length B) equal to 2d. Setting 3d+2d = 360° will find d = 72°, and so therefore Arc length A in degrees will equal 216° and arc length B will equal 144°. Finally, simply plug the two arc lengths into the tangent-tangent intersection theorem, and the answer: 1/2 (216°-144°) = 1/2 (72°) $=\\boxed{36 \\textbf{(C)}}.$  Let arc A be 3x and arc B be 2x. Then the angle formed by the tangents is $\\frac{3x-2x}2 = \\frac {x} 2$ by the arc length formula. Also note that $3x + 2x = 360$ , which simplifies to $x= 72.$ Hence the angle formed by the tangents is equal to $\\boxed{36 \\textbf{(C)}}$ . Let the center of the circle be $O$ . The radii extending from $O$ to the points of tangency $B$ and $C$ are both perpendicular to lines $AB$ and $AC$ . Thus $\\angle ABO = \\angle ACO = 90^{\\circ}$ , and quadrilateral $ABOC$ is cyclic, since the opposite angles add to $180^{\\circ}$ . Since the ratio of the arc lengths is $2 : 3$ , the shorter arc (the arc cut off by $\\angle BOC$ ) is $144^{\\circ}$ . $\\angle BOC$ and $\\angle BAC$ must add up to $180^{\\circ}$ since quadrilateral $ABOC$ is cyclic, so $\\angle BAC = 180 - 144 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(C) } 36}$ . -Solution by Joeya   2011 AMC 12B ( Problems • Answer Key • Resources )   Preceded by Problem 5   Followed by Problem 7    1  •  2  •  3  •  4  •  5  •  6  •  7  •  8  •  9  •  10  •  11  •  12  •  13  •  14  •  15  •  16  •  17  •  18  •  19  •  20  •  21  •  22  •  23  •  24  •  25    All AMC 12 Problems and Solutions  The problems on this page are copyrighted by the Mathematical Association of America 's American Mathematics Competitions .

      " To find Keiko's speed, all we need to find is the difference between the distance around the inside edge of the track and the distance around the outside edge of the track, and divide it by the difference in the time it takes her for each distance.  We are given the difference in time, so all we need to find is the difference between the distances. The track is divided into lengths and curves.  The lengths of the track will exhibit no difference in distance between the inside and outside edges, so we only need to concern ourselves with the curves. The curves of the track are semicircles, but since there are two of them, we can consider both of the at the same time by treating them as a single circle.  We need to find the difference in the circumferences of the inside and outside edges of the circle. The formula for the circumference of a circle is $C = 2 * \\pi * r$ where $r$ is the radius of the circle. Let's define the circumference of the inside circle as $C_1$ and the circumference of the outside circle as $C_2$ . If the radius of the inside circle ( $r_1$ ) is $n$ , then given the thickness of the track is 6 meters, the radius of the outside circle ( $r_2$ ) is $n + 6$ . Using this, the difference in the circumferences is: $C_2 - C_1 = 2 * \\pi * (r_2 - r_1) = 2 * \\pi * (n + 6 - n) = 2 * \\pi * 6 = 12\\pi$  $12\\pi$ is the difference between the inside and outside lengths of the track.

Because either $1$ , $5$ , or $7$ is always the change of the sum of the coordinates, the sum of the coordinates will always change from odd to even or vice versa. Thus, it can't go from $(0,0)$ to $(1,0)$ in an even number of moves. Therefore, the frog cannot reach $(1,0)$ in two moves.

      " Let's assume that the side length of the octagon is $x$ . The area of the center square is just $x^2$ . The triangles are all $45-45-90$ triangles, with a side length ratio of $1:1:\\sqrt{2}$ . The area of each of the $4$ identical triangles is $\\left(\\dfrac{x}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^2\\times\\dfrac{1}{2}=\\dfrac{x^2}{4}$ , so the total area of all of the triangles is also $x^2$ .

      " Name the directrix of the parabola $l$ . Define $d(X,k)$ to be the distance between a point $X$ and a line $k$ . Now we remember the geometric definition of a parabola: given any line $l$ (called the directrix) and any point $F$ (called the focus), the parabola corresponding to the given directrix and focus is the locus of the points that are equidistant from $F$ and $l$ . Therefore $FV=d(V,l)$ . Let this distance be $d$ . Now note that $d(F,l)=2d$ , so $d(A,l)=d(B,l)=2d$ . Therefore $AF=BF=2d$ . We now use the Pythagorean Theorem on triangle $AFV$ ; $AV=\\sqrt{AF^2+FV^2}=d\\sqrt{5}$ . Similarly, $BV=d\\sqrt{5}$ . We now use the Law of Cosines : \\[AB^2=AV^2+VB^2-2AV\\cdot VB\\cos{\\angle AVB}\\Rightarrow 16d^2=10d^2-10d^2\\cos{\\angle AVB}\\]  \\[\\Rightarrow \\cos{\\angle AVB}=-\\frac{3}{5}\\]  This shows that the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D)}}$ .  WLOG we can assume that the parabola is $y=x^2$ . Therefore $V = (0,0)$ and $F = (0,\\frac{1}{4})$ . Also $A = (-\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{4})$ and $B = (\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{4})$ . $AB = 1$ and $AV = VB = \\sqrt{(\\frac{1}{2})^2+(\\frac{1}{4})^2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{4}$ by the pythagorean theorem. Now using the law of cosines on $\\triangle AVB$ we have: $AB^2 = 2AV^2-2AV^2\\cos(\\angle AVB) = 2AV^2(1-\\cos(\\angle AVB))$  $1 = \\frac{5}{8} (1-\\cos(\\angle AVB))$  Thus, \\[\\cos(\\angle AVB) = \\boxed{\\textbf{(D)} -\\frac{3}{5}}.\\]  (solution by mihirb) After assuming that the parabola is $x^2$ ,find the points A and B, which are +/- 1,2,1/4.Now treat them as vectors,take the dot product,then find the magnitudes and multiply them.A well known definition of the dot product says that the quotient of the two is the cosine of the angle between them.This will give you D. As we know, an expression for the equation of a parabola is $y-k=\\frac{1}{4a}(x-h)^2$ , where $(h,k)$ is the vertex and $a$ is the distance from the focus to the vertex, here $F$ to $V$ . The length of the latus rectum, or $\\overline{AB}$ here, is equal to $|4a|$ . This means that $AF=BF=2a$ since $F$ is the midpoint of $AB$ . Then we can use right Triangle $VAF$ to figure out that $VA=\\frac{a\\sqrt{5}}{4}$ . Now we can use the fact that $\\cos{\\angle AVB}=\\cos{2 \\angle AVF}$ and use the double angle formula. This results in $\\cos{2 \\angle AVF}=2{\\cos}^2{\\angle AVF}-1$ . We can find $\\cos{\\angle AVF}$ from right triangle $AVF$ using the Pythagorean Theorem, which is $\\frac{a}{\\sqrt{5}}$ .

We know that rhombus $ABCD$ can be divided into equilateral triangles $\\triangle ABD$ and $\\triangle CBD$ . Using the $30-60-90$ special right triangle rules, we find the height of the equilateral triangles (and the height of the rhombus) to be $\\sqrt{3}$ . Therefore, the area of $ABCD$ is $2\\sqrt{3}$ . We now have to take off the areas $\\triangle CDA$ , $\\triangle CEF$ , and $\\triangle AIH$ to get the desired shape. $\\triangle CDA$ is just half of $ABCD$  $(\\sqrt {3})$ and $\\triangle AIH$ and $\\triangle CEF$ are each $\\frac{\\sqrt {3}}{6}$ , for a total area of $2\\sqrt {3}-\\sqrt {3}-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{6}-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{6}=\\boxed{(C)\\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{3}}$ . We split rhombus $ABCD$ into two equilateral triangles, $ABD$ and $BCD$ . In triangle $ABD$ , the probability that a randomly selected point is closer to $B$ than either other point is $\\frac{1}{3}$ (why?). Similarly, in triangle $BCD$ , the same principle applies. Thus, the area of the region closer to $B$ than $A$ , $C$ , or $D$ is $\\frac{1}{3} [ABD] + \\frac{1}{3} [BCD]$ .

Since $a$ is at most $9$ , $n = 1$ or $4$  If $n = 1$ , $|x-y| = 66$ , if $n = 4$ , $|x-y| = 132$ . In AMC, we are done. Otherwise, we need to show that $n=4$ , or $a^2 -b^2 = 44$ is impossible. $(a-b)(a+b) = 44$ -> $a-b = 1$ , or $2$ or $4$ and $a+b = 44$ , $22$ , $11$ respectively. And since $a+b \\le 18$ , $a+b = 11$ , $a-b = 4$ , but there is no integer solution for $a$ , $b$ . Short Cut We can arrive at $|x-y| = 6\\sqrt{11(a^2 - b^2)}$ using the method above. Because we know that $|x-y|$ is an integer, it must be a multiple of 6 and 11. Hence the answer is $66.$  In addition:\n",
      "Note that $11n$ with $n = 1$ may be obtained with $a = 6$ and $b = 5$ as $a^2 - b^2 = 36 - 25 = 11$ . It is easy to see that $(a,b)=(6,5)$ is the only solution. This yields $(x,y)=(98,32)$ . Their arithmetic mean is $65$ and their geometric mean is $56$ . Let $(x+y)/2 = 10a + b$ and $\\sqrt{xy} = 10b + a$ . By AM-GM we know that $a \\ge b$ . Squaring and multiplying by 4 on the first equation we get $x^2 + y^2 + 2xy = 400a^2 + 4b^2 + 80ab$ . Squaring and multiplying the second equation by 4 we get $4xy = 400b^2 + 4a^2 + 80ab$ . Subtracting we get $(x-y)^2 = 396(a^2 - b^2)$ . Note that $396 = 2^2 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 11$ . So to make it a perfect square $a^2 - b^2 = 11$ . From difference of squares , we see that $a = 6$ and $b = 5$ . So the answer is $3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 11 = 66$ . \n",

      "Notice that the bug is basically moving from A to B (length 10) but going on a detour in the middle.

The bug can start the \"detour\" from any point on or inside the rectangle. Notice that the bug can go 5 steps in the y direction, 5 steps in the x direction, or anything in between, so the points covered by possible detours from any point would look like a rhombus or square rotated 45 degrees (with centre at a point on or inside the rectangle).

      " Answer: (B) First of all, we need to find all $z$ such that $P(z) = 0$  $P(z) = \\left(z^4 - 1\\right)\\left(z^4 + \\left(4\\sqrt{3} + 7\\right)\\right)$  So $z^4 = 1 \\implies z =  e^{i\\frac{n\\pi}{2}}$  or $z^4 = - \\left(4\\sqrt{3} + 7\\right)$  $z^2 = \\pm i \\sqrt{4\\sqrt{3} + 7} = e^{i\\frac{(2n+1)\\pi}{2}} \\left(\\sqrt{3} + 2\\right)$  $z = e^{i\\frac{(2n+1)\\pi}{4}} \\sqrt{\\sqrt{3} + 2} = e^{i\\frac{(2n+1)\\pi}{4}} \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{2}} + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)$   Now we have a solution at $\\frac{n\\pi}{4}$ if we look at them in polar coordinate, further more, the 8-gon is symmetric (it is an equilateral octagon) . So we only need to find the side length of one and multiply by $8$ . So answer $= 8 \\times$ distance from $1$ to $\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\left(1 + i\\right)$  Side length $= \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} - \\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{2\\left(\\frac{3}{4} + \\frac{1}{4}\\right)} = \\sqrt{2}$  Hence, answer is $8\\sqrt{2}$ . Use the law of cosines.\n",
      "We make $a$ the distance.\n",
      "Now, since the angle does not change the distance from the origin, we can just use the distance. $a^2 = (\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{2}} + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}})^2 + 1^2 -2 \\times \\Big( \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{2}} + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\Big)\\times 1 \\times \\cos \\frac{\\pi}{4}$ , which simplifies to $a^2= 2 + \\sqrt3 +1 - 1 - \\sqrt3$ , or $a^2=2$ , or $a=\\sqrt2$ .\n",

      " Solution 1 Answer: $(D)  \\frac{34}{67}$  First of all, you have to realize that if $\\left[\\frac{n}{k}\\right] + \\left[\\frac{100 - n}{k}\\right] = \\left[\\frac{100}{k}\\right]$  then $\\left[\\frac{n - k}{k}\\right] + \\left[\\frac{100 - (n - k)}{k}\\right] = \\left[\\frac{100}{k}\\right]$  So, we can consider what happen in $1\\le n \\le k$ and it will repeat. Also since range of $n$ is $1$ to $99!$ , it is always a multiple of $k$ . So we can just consider $P(k)$ for $1\\le n \\le k$ . Let $\\text{fpart}(x)$ be the fractional part function This is an AMC exam, so use the given choices wisely. With the given choices, and the previous explanation, we only need to consider $k = 99$ , $87$ , $67$ , $13$ . $1\\le n \\le k$  For $k > \\frac{200}{3}$ , $\\left[\\frac{100}{k}\\right] = 1$ . 3 of the $k$ that we should consider land in here. For $n < \\frac{k}{2}$ , $\\left[\\frac{n}{k}\\right] = 0$ , then we need $\\left[\\frac{100 - n}{k}\\right] = 1$  else for $\\frac{k}{2}< n < k$ , $\\left[\\frac{n}{k}\\right] = 1$ , then we need $\\left[\\frac{100 - n}{k}\\right] = 0$   For $n < \\frac{k}{2}$ , $\\left[\\frac{100 - n}{k}\\right] = \\left[\\frac{100}{k} - \\frac{n}{k}\\right]= 1$  So, for the condition to be true, $100 - n > \\frac{k}{2}$ .  ( $k > \\frac{200}{3}$ , no worry for the rounding to be $> 1$ ) $100 > k > \\frac{k}{2} + n$ , so this is always true. For $\\frac{k}{2}< n < k$ , $\\left[\\frac{100 - n}{k}\\right] = 0$ , so we want $100 - n < \\frac{k}{2}$ , or $100 < \\frac{k}{2} + n$  $100 <\\frac{k}{2} + n <  \\frac{3k}{2}$  For k = 67, $67 > n > 100 - \\frac{67}{2} = 66.5$  For k = 69, $69 > n > 100 - \\frac{69}{2} = 67.5$  etc. We can clearly see that for this case, $k = 67$ has the minimum $P(k)$ , which is $\\frac{34}{67}$ . Also, $\\frac{7}{13} > \\frac{34}{67}$ . So for AMC purpose, answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) }\\frac{34}{67}}$ . Proof: Notice that for these integers $99,87,67$ :  $0\\rightarrow 49,50,51\\rightarrow 98$  $100\\rightarrow 51,50,49\\rightarrow 2$  $P=\\frac{98}{99}$   $0\\rightarrow 43,44\\rightarrow 56,57\\rightarrow 86$  $87\\rightarrow 57,56\\rightarrow 44,43\\rightarrow 14$  $P=\\frac{74}{87}$   $0\\rightarrow 33,34\\rightarrow 66$  $100\\rightarrow 67,66\\rightarrow 34$  $P=\\frac{34}{67}$  That the probability is $\\frac{2k-100}{k}=2-\\frac{100}{k}$ . Even for $k=13$ , $P(13)=\\frac{9}{13}=\\frac{100}{13}-7$ . And $P(11)=\\frac{10}{11}=10-\\frac{100}{11}$ . Perhaps the probability for a given $k$ is $\\left\\lceil{\\frac{100}{k}}\\right\\rceil-\\frac{100}{k}$ if $\\left[\\frac{100}{k}\\right]=\\left\\lfloor{\\frac{100}{k}}\\right\\rfloor$ and $\\frac{100}{k}-\\left\\lfloor{\\frac{100}{k}}\\right\\rfloor$ if $\\left[\\frac{100}{k}\\right]=\\left\\lceil{\\frac{100}{k}}\\right\\rceil$ . So $P>\\frac{1}{2}$ and $P_\\text{min}=\\frac{k_\\text{min}+1}{2k_\\text{min}}=\\frac{101}{201}$ . Because $201=3\\cdot 67\\mid 99!$ !   Now, let's say we are not given any answer, we need to consider $k < \\frac{200}{3}$ . I claim that $P(k) \\ge \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2k}$  If $\\left[\\frac{100}{k}\\right]$ got round down, then $1 \\le n \\le \\frac{k}{2}$ all satisfy the condition along with $n = k$  because if $\\text{fpart}\\left(\\frac{100}{k}\\right) < \\frac{1}{2}$ and $\\text{fpart} \\left(\\frac{n}{k}\\right) < \\frac{1}{2}$ , so must $\\text{fpart} \\left(\\frac{100 - n}{k}\\right) < \\frac{1}{2}$  and for $n = k$ , it is the same as $n = 0$ . , which makes $P(k) \\ge \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2k}$ . If $\\left[\\frac{100}{k}\\right]$ got round up, then $\\frac{k}{2} \\le n \\le k$ all satisfy the condition along with $n = 1$  because if $\\text{fpart}\\left(\\frac{100}{k}\\right) > \\frac{1}{2}$ and $\\text{fpart} \\left(\\frac{n}{k}\\right) > \\frac{1}{2}$  Case 1) $\\text{fpart} \\left(\\frac{100 - n}{k}\\right) < \\frac{1}{2}$  -> $\\text{fpart}\\left(\\frac{100}{k}\\right) = \\text{fpart} \\left(\\frac{n}{k}\\right) +\\text{fpart} \\left(\\frac{100 - n}{k}\\right)$  Case 2) $\\text{fpart} \\left(\\frac{100 - n}{k}\\right) > \\frac{1}{2}$  -> $\\text{fpart}\\left(\\frac{100}{k}\\right) + 1 = \\text{fpart} \\left(\\frac{n}{k}\\right) +\\text{fpart} \\left(\\frac{100 - n}{k}\\right)$  and for $n = 1$ , since $k$ is odd, $\\left[\\frac{99}{k}\\right] \\neq \\left[\\frac{100}{k}\\right]$  -> $99.5 = k (p + .5)$ -> $199 = k (2p + 1)$ , and $199$ is prime so $k = 1$ or $k =199$ , which is not in this set , which makes $P(k) \\ge \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2k}$ . Now the only case without rounding, $k = 1$ . It must be true. Solution 2 It suffices to consider $0\\le n \\le k-1.$ Now for each of these $n,$ let $f(n)=\\left[\\frac{n}{k}\\right], g(n)=\\left[\\frac{100-n}{k}\\right]-\\left[\\frac{100}{k}\\right].$ If we let $k=67,$ then the following graphs result for $f$ and $g.$  $f:$  [asy] size(10cm); for (int i = 0; i < 67; ++i) { \tif (i<=33) dot((i,0));     else dot((i,1)); } label(\"(0,0)\",(0,0),SW); label(\"(66,1)\",(66,1),NE); [/asy]  $g:$  [asy] size(10cm); for (int i = 0; i < 67; ++i) { \tdot((i,0)); } label(\"(0,0)\",(0,0),NW); label(\"(66,0)\",(66,0),SE); [/asy]  Our probability is the number of $0\\le i \\le k-1$ such that $f(i)+g(i)=0$ over $k.$ Of course, this always holds for $i=0.$ If we let $k$ vary, then the graph of $f$ is always very similar to what it looks like above (groups of $\\frac{k+1}{2},\\frac{k-1}{2}$ dots). However, the graph of $g$ can vary greatly. In the above diagram, $g(i)=0$ for all $i,$ while it is possible for $g(i)=-1$ for all $i\\neq 0.$ In order to minimize the number of $i$ which satisfy $f(i)+g(i)=0,$ we either want $g(i)=0$ for $0\\le i<k,$ or $g(i)=-1$ for $1\\le i<k.$ This way, we see that at least half of the numbers from $1$ to $k-1$ satisfy the given equation. So, our desired probability is at least $\\frac{k+1}{2k}.$ As shown by the diagram above, the probability is $\\frac{34}{67}$ for $k=67.$ Clearly no better solutions can exist when $k<67.$ On the other hand, for $k>67$  $87$ and $99$ do not yield better probabilities. Therefore, our answer is $\\boxed{\\frac{34}{67}}.$    2011 AMC 12B ( Problems • Answer Key • Resources )   Preceded by Problem 24   Followed by Last Problem    1  •  2  •  3  •  4  •  5  •  6  •  7  •  8  •  9  •  10  •  11  •  12  •  13  •  14  •  15  •  16  •  17  •  18  •  19  •  20  •  21  •  22  •  23  •  24  •  25    All AMC 12 Problems and Solutions  The problems on this page are copyrighted by the Mathematical Association of America 's American Mathematics Competitions .

      " Let $a_1$ be the first term of the arithmetic progression and $a_{12}$ be the last term of the arithmetic progression. From the formula of the sum of an arithmetic progression (or arithmetic series), we have $12*\\frac{a_1+a_{12}}{2}=360$ , which leads us to $a_1 + a_{12} = 60$ . $a_{12}$ , the largest term of the progression, can also be expressed as $a_1+11d$ , where $d$ is the common difference. Since each angle measure must be an integer, $d$ must also be an integer. We can isolate $d$ by subtracting $a_1$ from $a_{12}$ like so: $a_{12}-a_1=a_1+11d-a_1=11d$ . Since $d$ is an integer, the difference between the first and last terms, $11d$ , must be divisible by $11.$ Since the total difference must be less than $60$ , we can start checking multiples of $11$ less than $60$ for the total difference between $a_1$ and $a_{12}$ . We start with the largest multiple, because the maximum difference will result in the minimum value of the first term.

Draw the triangle shown in the figure above and write expressions in terms of $s$ (length of the side of the square) for the sides of the triangle. Because $AO$ is the radius of the larger circle, which is equal to $2$ , we can write the Pythagorean Theorem. \\begin{align*} \\left( \\frac{s}{2} \\right) ^2 + (s+1)^2 &= 2^2\\\\ \\frac14 s^2 + s^2 + 2s + 1 &= 4\\\\ \\frac54 s^2 +2s - 3 &= 0\\\\ 5s^2 + 8s - 12 &=0 \\end{align*}  Use the quadratic formula. \\[s = \\frac{-8+\\sqrt{8^2-4(5)(-12)}}{10} = \\frac{-8+\\sqrt{304}}{10} = \\frac{-8+4\\sqrt{19}}{10} = \\boxed{\\textbf{(D)}\\ \\frac{2\\sqrt{19}-4}{5}}\\]  Using the diagram above, we look at the top-right vertex of the square. Let us call this point $(x,y)$ . Then, we that since the square is symmetrical over the y-axis, that the y value is equal to $2x+1$ , since we can multiply the x value(which is half of $s$ ) by two to get $s$ , and we add one since the square lies one unit above the origin. Now, all we must do is find the intersection of the larger circle, $x^2 + y^2 = 4$ , and the line $y=2x+1$ . Substituting the second equation into the first, we get: $5x^2 +4x -3 = 0$  Using the quadratic formula, we arrive with $x=\\frac{-4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{19}}{10}$ . However, recall that the x value is only one half of the side length. Multiplying this value by $2$ , then, and using only the positive root(since the top right vertex of the square has a positive x value), we get: $\\frac{-4 + 2\\sqrt{19}}{5} \\Rightarrow \\boxed{\\textbf{(D)}}$  Like the previous solutions, we can say that the square is symmetrical with respect to the y-axis. Since CD passes through point (0,1), let C be (-x,1) and D be (x,1) Point B is $\\left(-x, \\sqrt{4-x^2}\\right)$ and Point A is $\\left(x,\\sqrt{4-x^2}\\right)$ . Now, we see that AB = 2x and BC = $\\sqrt{4-x^2}$ -1 Setting those two equal, we get the same equation as the previous solutions: $5x^2 +4x -3 = 0$ and then solve the same way. -Conantwiz2023\n",

      " First, look for invariants. The center, unaffected by rotation, must be black. So automatically, the chance is less than $\\frac{1}{2}.$ Note that a $90^{\\circ}$ rotation requires that black squares be across from each other across a vertical or horizontal axis. As such, $2$ squares directly across from each other must be black in the $4$ edge squares. Since there are $2$ configurations for this to be possible (top and bottom, right and left), this is a chance of \\[\\left (\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\right )+ \\left (\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\right )=\\frac{1}{2}\\]  However, by PIE , subtract the chance all 4 are black and both configurations are met: $\\frac{1}{2}- \\left (\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\right ) \\cdot \\left (\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\right )=\\frac{7}{16}$ . Through symmetrical reasoning, the corners also have a $\\frac{7}{16}$ chance of having a configuration that yields all black corners. Then, the chance that all squares black is the intersection of all these probabilities: $\\frac{1}{2} \\left (\\frac{7}{16} \\right ) \\left (\\frac{7}{16} \\right ) = \\boxed{\\textbf{(A)}\\ \\frac{49}{512}}$   ~BJHHar Also, if you have little to no time and are guessing, notice there are a total of $2^9 = 512$ ways to permutate the colors on the square (Each square can be white or black, so there are 2 possibilities for each of the 9 squares). Thus, the answer must be in some form of $\\frac{\\text{the number of good cases}}{\\text{the total number of cases}}$ , so E is not possible. Also, since the number of good cases must be an integer, C is not possible. From there, your chances of guessing the right answer are slightly higher. ~Extremelysupercooldude First, there is only one way for the middle square to be black because it is not affected by the rotation. Then we can consider the corners and edges separately. Let's first just consider the number of ways we can color the corners. There is $1$ case with all-black squares. There are four cases with one white square and all $4$ work. There are six cases with two white squares, but only the $2$ with the white squares diagonal from each other works. There are no cases with three white squares or four white squares. Then the total number of ways to color the corners is $1+4+2=7$ . In essence, the edges work the same way, so there are also $7$ ways to color them. The number of ways to fit the conditions over the number of ways to color the squares is \\[\\frac{7\\times7}{2^9}=\\boxed{\\textbf{(A)}\\ \\frac{49}{512}}\\]  We proceed by casework.\n",
      "Note that the middle square must be black because when rotated 90 degrees, it must keep its position. Now we have to deal with the following cases: Case 1: 0 white squares.\n",
      "There is exactly $1$ way to color the grid this way. Case 2: 1 white square.\n",
      "Note that the white square can be anywhere on the grid except for the middle square because when rotating 90 degrees it can never land on itself. Thus, there are $8$ cases. Case 3: 2 white squares. \n",
      "We have $\\binom{8}{2}=28$ ways to color two white squares without restrictions (the middle square must be black, giving us 8 squares to choose from). However, we must subtract the ways where two white squares differ by a rotation of 90 degrees about the middle of the square. There are a total of 8 cases we must subtract (these are not too hard to see). Thus, there are $20$ ways from this. Case 4: 3 white squares.\n",
      "Since we can not change the middle square, there are $\\binom{8}{3}=56$ ways to color this. However, we must consider the cases where at least two squares differ by a rotation of 90 degrees. We can count this with PIE: by the Principle of Exclusion, the number of cases we want to exclude is the number of cases where 2 squares differ by a rotation of 90 degrees and minus when there are 3 squares such that two of them differ by rotation of 90 and 1 of them differs by rotation of 180, because of the overcount from our first case. \n",
      "From case 2, there are 8 causes such that two squares differ by a rotation of 90. There are also 6 other places we can place the third square (it can't be the middle of the two that we already colored), for a total of 48 ways. We have to subtract the second case. Note that there are 8 ways in which we can arrange two squares differing by 180 degrees. Out of these, each one has two ways to put another square such that two differ by 90 degrees and 1 pair differs by 180. However, this is overcounted by a factor of 2, so there are act/2=8 ways. \n",
      "Thus, we have $56-(48-8)=16$ ways in this case. Case 5: 4 white squares.\n",
      "Note that two of them have to be on one of the 4 corner squares, and two of them have to be on one of the 4 edge squares. Each solution yields two combinations, for a total of 2 * 2 = 4.\n",
      "Adding up our cases yields 1+8+20+16+4=49 ways. There are 512 ways to color the square without restrictions. Thus, the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A)}\\ 49/512}$ .\n",

Since $YO=OX=r$ , the law of cosines on triangle $YOX$ gives us $\\cos t =-79/121$ . Again since $ZYOX$ is cyclic, the measure of angle $YZX=180-t$ .

Note Instead of using the Extended Law of Sines, you can note that $OX = OY \\implies \\text{arc}\\ OX =\\text{arc}\\ OY \\implies \\angle{OZY} \\cong \\angle{OZX}$ , since the angles inscribe arcs of the same length.

Pulling an altitude to $XY$ from $O$ , we obtain $\\cos(\\angle{OXY}) = \\frac{10}{11}$ . Since quadrilateral $ZYOX$ is cyclic, we have $\\angle{OXY}=\\angle{OZY}$ , so $\\cos(\\angle{OXY}) = \\cos(\\angle{OZY})$ .

Let $A$ be the point of intersection of $C_1$ and $XZ$ . We now have $AZ=YZ=7$ and $XA=6$ . Furthermore, notice that $\\triangle XAO$ is isosceles, thus the altitude from $O$ to $XA$ bisects $XZ$ at point $B$ above.

Notice that $\\angle YZO=\\angle XZO$ as they subtend arcs of the same length. Let $A$ be the point of intersection of $C_1$ and $XZ$ . We now have $AZ=YZ=7$ and $XA=6$ . Consider the power of point $Z$ with respect to Circle $O,$ we have $13\\cdot 7 = (11 + r)(11 - r) = 11^2 - r^2,$ which gives $r=\\boxed{\\sqrt{30}}.$  Note that $OX$ and $OY$ are the same length, which is also the radius $R$ we want. Using the law of cosines on $\\triangle OYZ$ , we have $11^2=R^2+7^2-2\\cdot 7 \\cdot R \\cdot \\cos\\theta$ , where $\\theta$ is the angle formed by $\\angle{OYZ}$ . Since $\\angle{OYZ}$ and $\\angle{OXZ}$ are supplementary, $\\angle{OXZ}=\\pi-\\theta$ .

Solving for theta on the first equation and substituting gives $\\frac{72-R^2}{14R}=\\frac{48+R^2}{26R}$ . Solving for R gives $R=\\textbf{(E)}\\ \\boxed{\\sqrt{30}}$ . We first note that $C_2$ is the circumcircle of both $\\triangle XOZ$ and $\\triangle OYZ$ . Thus the circumradius of both the triangles are equal. We set the radius of $C_1$ as $r$ , and noting that the circumradius of a triangle is $\\frac{abc}{4A}$ and that the area of a triangle by Heron's formula is $\\sqrt{(S)(S-a)(S-b)(S-c)}$ with $S$ as the semi-perimeter we have the following, \\begin{align*}\\dfrac{r \\cdot 13 \\cdot 11}{4\\sqrt{(12 + \\frac{r}{2})(12 - \\frac{r}{2})(1 + \\frac{r}{2})(\\frac{r}{2} - 1)}} &= \\dfrac{r \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11}{4\\sqrt{(9 + \\frac{r}{2})(9 - \\frac{r}{2})(2 + \\frac{r}{2})(\\frac{r}{2} - 2)}} \\\\ \\dfrac{13}{\\sqrt{(144- \\frac{r^2}{4})(\\frac{r^2}{4} - 1)}} &= \\dfrac{7}{\\sqrt{(81- \\frac{r^2}{4})(\\frac{r^2}{4} - 4)}} \\\\ 169 \\cdot (81 - \\frac{r^2}{4})(\\frac{r^2}{4} - 4) &= 49 \\cdot (144 - \\frac{r^2}{4})(\\frac{r^2}{4} - 1) .\\end{align*} Now substituting $a = \\frac{r^2}{4}$ , \\begin{align*}169a^2 - (85) \\cdot 169 a + 4 \\cdot 81 \\cdot 169 &= 49a^2 - (145) \\cdot 49 a + 144 \\cdot 49 \\\\ 120a^2 - 7260a + 47700 &= 0 \\\\ 2a^2 - 121a + 795 &= 0 \\\\ (2a-15)(a-53) &= 0 \\\\ a = \\frac{15}{2}, 53.\\end{align*} This gives us 2 values for $r$ namely $r = \\sqrt{4 \\cdot \\frac{15}{2}} = \\sqrt{30}$ and $r = \\sqrt{4 \\cdot 53} = 2\\sqrt{53}$ . Now notice that we can apply Ptolemy's theorem on $XOYZ$ to find $XY$ in terms of $r$ . We get \\begin{align*}11 \\cdot XY &= 13r + 7r \\\\ XY &= \\frac{20r}{11}.\\end{align*} Here we substitute our $2$ values of $r$ receiving $XY = \\frac{20\\sqrt{30}}{11}, \\frac{40\\sqrt{53}}{11}$ . Notice that the latter of the $2$ cases does not satisfy the triangle inequality for $\\triangle XYZ$ as $\\frac{40\\sqrt{53}}{11} \\approx 26.5 > 7 + 13 = 20$ . But the former does thus our answer is $\\textbf{(E)}\\ \\boxed{\\sqrt{30}}$ . ~Aaryabhatta1 We first apply Ptolemy's Theorem on cyclic quadrilateral  $XZYO$ to get $13r+7r = 11 \\cdot XY \\Longrightarrow XY=\\frac{20r}{11}$ .  Since $\\angle ZXY = \\angle ZOY$ and $\\angle XZO = \\angle XYO$ . From this, we can see $\\triangle ZPY \\sim \\triangle XPO$ and $\\triangle ZPX \\sim \\triangle YPO$ . That means $ZP:PY = 13:r, \\: ZP:PX = 7:r, \\: XP:PO = 13:r$ . So, if you let $PY=x$ , you will get $ZP = \\frac{13x}{r}$ . Continuing in this fashion, we can get $XP = \\frac{13x}{r} \\cdot \\frac{r}{7} = \\frac{13x}{7}$ and $PO = \\frac{13x}{7} \\cdot \\frac{r}{13} = \\frac{xr}{7}$ . Since $XY = \\frac{20r}{11} = XP+PY$ , we have $x+\\frac{13x}{7} = \\frac{20r}{11}$ which gives us $x=\\frac{7r}{11}$ . Plugging it into $ZO = 11 = ZP+PO$ gives \\[\\frac{13x}{r} + \\frac{xr}{7} = \\frac{13 \\cdot \\frac{7r}{11}}{r} + \\frac{r \\cdot \\frac{7r}{11}}{7} = \\frac{91}{11} + \\frac{r^2}{11} = 11.\\]  Solving for $r$ yields $r=\\boxed{\\sqrt{30}}$ . ~sml1809\n",

For the first case, we rewrite 1mod(5) in the form 5k+1. Because 5k+1 < 30, which is the largest element in the sequence possible, we obtain k=5. In addition, for 3mod(5), we have 3x+5<30, x=5. This gives us 5+5=10 solutions. The reason why we can add these elements is because all of these elements, no matter which two you add, can never be a multiple of 5. The only possible remainders for the sum are 1+1, 1+3, or 3+3. In a similar manner, we calculate the element using the same logic. We find that 2mod(5) has 5 elements, and 1mod(5) has 8 elements, meaning that there are a total of 13 elements, which is the answer. \n",

      " Inscribe circle $C$ of radius $r$ inside triangle $ABC$ so that it meets $AB$ at $Q$ , $BC$ at $R$ , and $AC$ at $S$ . Note that angle bisectors of triangle $ABC$ are concurrent at the center $O$ (also $I$ ) of circle $C$ . Let $x=QB$ , $y=RC$ and $z=AS$ . Note that $BR=x$ , $SC=y$ and $AQ=z$ . Hence $x+z=27$ , $x+y=25$ , and $z+y=26$ . Subtracting the last 2 equations we have $x-z=-1$ and adding this to the first equation we have $x=13$ . By Heron's formula for the area of a triangle we have that the area of triangle $ABC$ is $\\sqrt{39(14)(13)(12)}$ . On the other hand the area is given by $(1/2)25r+(1/2)26r+(1/2)27r$ .  Then $39r=\\sqrt{39(14)(13)(12)}$ so that $r^2=56$ . Since the radius of circle $O$ is perpendicular to $BC$ at $R$ , we have by the pythagorean theorem $BO^2=BI^2=r^2+x^2=56+169=225$ so that $BI=\\boxed{\\textbf{(A) } 15}$ . We can use mass points and Stewart's to solve this problem. Because we are looking at the Incenter we then label $A$ with a mass of $25$ , $B$ with $26$ , and $C$ with $27$ . We also label where the angle bisectors intersect the opposite side $A'$ , $B'$ , and $C'$ correspondingly. It follows then that point $B'$ has mass $52$ . Which means that $\\overline{BB'}$ is split into a $2:1$ ratio. We can then use Stewart's to find $\\overline{BB'}$ . So we have $25^2\\frac{27}{2} + 27^2\\frac{25}{2} = \\frac{25 \\cdot 26 \\cdot 27}{4} + 26\\overline{BB'}^2$ . Solving we get $\\overline{BB'} = \\frac{45}{2}$ . Plugging it in we get $\\overline{BI} = 15$ . Therefore the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A) } 15}$  -Solution by arowaaron  We can use POP(Power of a point) to solve this problem. First, notice that the area of $\\triangle ABC$ is $\\sqrt{39(39 - 27)(39 - 26)(39 - 25)} = 78\\sqrt{14}$ . Therefore, using the formula that $sr = A$ , where $s$ is the semi-perimeter and $r$ is the length of the inradius, we find that $r = 2\\sqrt{14}$ . Draw radii to the three tangents, and let the tangent hitting $BC$ be $T_1$ , the tangent hitting $AB$ be $T_2$ , and the tangent hitting $AC$ be $T_3$ . Let $BI = x$ . By the pythagorean theorem, we know that $BT_1 = \\sqrt{x^2 - 56}$ . By POP, we also know that $BT_2$ is also $\\sqrt{x^2 - 56}$ . Because we know that $BC = 25$ , we find that $CT_1 = 25 - \\sqrt{x^2 - 56}$ . We can rinse and repeat and find that $AT_2 = 26 - (25 - \\sqrt{x^2 - 56}) = 1 + \\sqrt{x^2 - 56}$ . We can find $AT_2$ by essentially coming in from the other way. Since $AB = 27$ , we also know that $AT_3 = 27 - \\sqrt{x^2 - 56}$ . By POP, we know that $AT_2 = AT_3$ , so $1 + \\sqrt{x^2 - 56} = 27 - \\sqrt{x^2 - 56}$ . Let $\\sqrt{x^2 - 56} = A$ , for simplicity. We can change the equation into $1 + A = 27 - A$ , which we find $A$ to be $13$ . Therefore, $\\sqrt{x^2 - 56} = 13$ , which further implies that $x^2 - 56 = 169$ . After simplifying, we find $x^2 = 225$ , so $x = \\boxed{\\textbf{(A) } 15}$  ~EricShi1685\n",

      " Note that if $n$ is the number of friends each person has, then $n$ can be any integer from $1$ to $4$ , inclusive. One person can have at most 4 friends since they cannot be all friends (stated in the problem). Also note that the cases of $n=1$ and $n=4$ are the same, since a map showing a solution for $n=1$ can correspond one-to-one with a map of a solution for $n=4$ by simply making every pair of friends non-friends and vice versa.  The same can be said of configurations with $n=2$ when compared to configurations of $n=3$ .  Thus, we have two cases to examine, $n=1$ and $n=2$ , and we count each of these combinations twice. (Note: If you aren’t familiar with one-to-one correspondences, think of it like this: the number of ways to choose 4 friends is equal to number of ways to exclude one friend from your friend group. Hence, since the number of ways to choose 1 friend is the same thing as choosing 1 to not be friends with, $n=1$ and $n=4$ have the same number of ways. Similarly, $n=2$ and $n=3$ have the same number of ways as well. ~peelybonehead) For $n=1$ , if everyone has exactly one friend, that means there must be $3$ pairs of friends, with no other interconnections.  The first person has $5$ choices for a friend.  There are $4$ people left.  The next person has $3$ choices for a friend.  There are two people left, and these remaining two must be friends.  Thus, there are $15$ configurations with $n=1$ . For $n=2$ , there are two possibilities.  The group of $6$ can be split into two groups of $3$ , with each group creating a friendship triangle.  The first person has $\\binom{5}{2} = 10$ ways to pick two friends from the other five, while the other three are forced together.  Thus, there are $10$ triangular configurations. However, the group can also form a friendship hexagon, with each person sitting on a vertex, and each side representing the two friends that person has.  The first person may be seated anywhere on the hexagon without loss of generality .  This person has $\\binom{5}{2} = 10$ choices for the two friends on the adjoining vertices.  Each of the three remaining people can be seated \"across\" from one of the original three people, forming a different configuration.  Thus, there are $10 \\cdot 3! = 60$ hexagonal configurations, and in total $70$ configurations for $n=2$ . As stated before, $n=3$ has $70$ configurations, and $n=4$ has $15$ configurations.  This gives a total of $(70 + 15)\\cdot 2 = 170$ configurations, which is option $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B)}\\ 170}$ . Note We can also calculate the triangular configurations by applying $\\frac{\\binom{6}{3}}{2} = \\frac{20}{2}=10$ (Because choosing $A$ , $B$ and $C$ is the same as choosing $D$ , $E$ and $F$ . For the hexagonal configurations, we know that the total amount of combinations is $6!=720$ . However, we must correct for our  overcounting because of rotation and reflection. We have that there are ${720 \\over 6 \\cdot 2} = 60$ because there $6$ rotations of the hexagon and 2 reflections (clockwise and counterclockwise) for each valid way. Note 2 We can also calculate the hexagonal configurations by placing each person at a random vertex (6!) and dividing for rotations (by 6) and reflections (by 2):  $\\frac{6!}{12}=60$  Note 3 For the hexagonal configuration, it is essentially congruent to counting the number of paths that start and end with A. From $A$ , we have $5$ options, then the next one has $4$ , and so on, so we have: $5\\cdot 4 \\hdots 1 \\cdot 1$ , where the final $1$ is because the final point needs to reconnect to $A$ . Thus, there are $5! = 120$ ways. Dividng by $2$ since we overcounted by accounting for both directions, we have $120/2 = \\fbox{60}$  -bigbrain123 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92X9ePsgPRU  This is similar to a certain 2023 Mathcounts Chapter Problem.....\n",

      " Every term in the expansion of the product is formed by taking one term from each factor and multiplying them all together. Therefore, we pick a power of $x$ or a power of $2$ from each factor. Every number, including $2012$ , has a unique representation by the sum of powers of two, and that representation can be found by converting a number to its binary form. $2012 = 11111011100_2$ , meaning $2012 = 1024 + 512 + 256 + 128 + 64 + 16 + 8 + 4$ . Thus, the $x^{2012}$ term was made by multiplying $x^{1024}$ from the $(x^{1024} + 1024)$ factor, $x^{512}$ from the $(x^{512} + 512)$ factor, and so on. The only numbers not used are $32$ , $2$ , and $1$ . Thus, from the $(x^{32} + 32), (x^2+2), (x+1)$ factors, $32$ , $2$ , and $1$ were chosen as opposed to $x^{32}, x^2$ , and $x$ . Thus, the coefficient of the $x^{2012}$ term is $32 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 64 = 2^6$ . So the answer is $6 \\rightarrow \\boxed{B}$ . The degree of $P(x)$ is $1024+512+256+\\cdots+1=2047$ .

These will be all the possible $p_j$ 's. First, there are two kinds of segments joining the midpoints of every pair of edges belonging to the same face of $Q$ : long traces are those connecting the midpoint of opposite sides of the same face of $Q$ , and short traces are those connecting the midpoint of adjacent sides of the same face of $Q$ . Suppose $p_j$ contains a short trace $t_1$ of a face of $Q$ . Then it must also contain some trace $t_2$ of an adjacent face of $Q$ , where $t_2$ share a common endpoint with $t_1$ . So, there are three possibilities for $t_2$ , each of which determines a plane $p_j$ containing both $t_1$ and $t_2$ . Case 1:  $t_2$ makes an acute angle with $t_1$ . In this case, $p_j \\cap Q$ is an equilateral triangle made by three short traces. There are $8$ of them, corresponding to the $8$ vertices. Case 2:  $t_2$ is a long trace. $p \\cap Q$ is a rectangle. Each pair of parallel faces of $Q$ contributes $4$ of these rectangles so there are $12$ such rectangles. Case 3:  $t_2$ is the short trace other than the one described in case 1, i.e. $t_2$ makes an obtuse angle with $t_1$ . It is possible to prove that $p \\cap Q$ is a regular hexagon (See note #1 for a proof) and there are $4$ of them. Case 4:  $p_j$ contains no short traces. This can only make $p_j \\cap Q$ be a square enclosed by long traces.  There are $3$ such squares. In total, there are $8+12+4+3=27$ possible planes in $P$ . So the maximum of $k$ is $27$ . On the other hand, the most economic way to generate these long and short traces is to take all the planes in case 3 and case 4. Overall, they intersect at each trace exactly once (there is a quick way to prove this. See note #2 below.) and also covered all the $6\\times 4 + 4\\times 3 = 36$ traces. So the minimum of $k$ is $7$ . The answer to this problem is then $27-7=20$ ... $\\framebox{C}$ . Note 1 : Indeed, let $t_1=AB$ where $B=t_1\\cap t_2$ , and $C$ be the other endpoint of $t_2$ that is not $B$ . Draw a line through $A$ parallel to $t_1$ . This line passes through the center $O$ of the cube and therefore we see that the reflection of $A,B,C$ , denoted by $A', B', C'$ , respectively, lie on the same plane containing $A,B,C$ . Thus $p_j \\cap Q$ is the regular hexagon $ABCA'B'C'$ . To count the number of these hexagons, just notice that each short trace uniquely determine a hexagon (by drawing the plane through this trace and the center), and that each face has $4$ short traces. Therefore, there are $4$ such hexagons. Note 2 : The quick way to prove the fact that none of the planes described in case 3 and case 4 share the same trace is as follows: each of these plane contains the center and therefore the intersection of each pair of them is a line through the center, which obviously does not contain any traces. https://artofproblemsolving.com/videos/amc/2012amc12a/251  ~dolphin7\n",

Because $S$ square is not parallel to the axis, the two points must be adjacent. Now consider the unit square $U$ with vertices $(0,0), (1,0), (1,1)$ and $(0,1)$ . Let us first consider only two vertices, $(0,0)$ and $(1,0)$ . We want to find the area of the region within $U$ that the point $v=(x,y)$ will create the translation of $S$ , $T(v)$ such that it covers both $(0,0)$ and $(1,0)$ . By symmetry, there will be three equal regions that cover the other pairs of adjacent vertices. For $T(v)$ to contain the point $(0,0)$ , $v$ must be inside square $S$ . Similarly, for $T(v)$ to contain the point $(1,0)$ , $v$ must be inside a translated square $S$ with center at $(1,0)$ , which we will call $S'$ . Therefore, the area we seek is Area $(U \\cap S \\cap S')$ . To calculate the area, we notice that Area $(U \\cap S \\cap S') = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot$ Area $(S \\cap S')$ by symmetry. Let $S_1 = (0.1, 0.7), S_2 = (0.7, -0.1), S'_1 = (1.1, 0.7), S'_2 = (0.3, 0.1)$ . Let $M = (0.7, 0.4)$ be the midpoint of $S'_1S'_2$ , and $N = (0.7, 0.7)$ along the line $S_1S'_1$ .

Therefore, the area we seek is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot$ Area $(S \\cap S') = \\frac{1}{2} [IS'_2JS_2]$ . Because $S_2, M, N$ all have $x$ coordinate $0.7$ , they are collinear. Noting that the side length of $S$ and $S'$ is $1$ (as shown above), we also see that $S_2M = MS'_1 = 0.5$ , so $\\triangle{S'_1NM} \\cong \\triangle{S_2IM}$ . If follows that $IS_2 = NS'_1 = 1.1 - 0.7 = 0.4$ and $IS'_2 = MS'_2 - MI = MS'_2 - MN = 0.5 - 0.3 = 0.2$ .

      " First, we must understand two important functions: $f(x) = b^x$ for $0 < b < 1$ (decreasing exponential function), and $g(x) = x^k$ for $k > 0$ (increasing power function for positive $x$ ). $f(x)$ is used to establish inequalities when we change the exponent and keep the base constant. $g(x)$ is used to establish inequalities when we change the base and keep the exponent constant. We will now examine the first few terms. Comparing $a_1$ and $a_2$ , $0 < a_1 = (0.201)^1 < (0.201)^{a_1} < (0.2011)^{a_1} = a_2 < 1 \\Rightarrow 0 < a_1 < a_2 < 1$ . Therefore, $0 < a_1 < a_2 < 1$ . Comparing $a_2$ and $a_3$ , $0 < a_3 = (0.20101)^{a_2} < (0.20101)^{a_1} < (0.2011)^{a_1} = a_2 < 1 \\Rightarrow 0 < a_3 < a_2 < 1$ . Comparing $a_1$ and $a_3$ , $0 < a_1 = (0.201)^1 < (0.201)^{a_2} < (0.20101)^{a_2} = a_3 < 1 \\Rightarrow 0 < a_1 < a_3 < 1$ . Therefore, $0 < a_1 < a_3 < a_2 < 1$ . Comparing $a_3$ and $a_4$ , $0 < a_3 = (0.20101)^{a_2} < (0.20101)^{a_3} < (0.201011)^{a_3} = a_4 < 1 \\Rightarrow 0 < a_3 < a_4 < 1$ .

Continuing in this manner, it is easy to see a pattern(see Note 1). Therefore, the only $k$ when $a_k = b_k$ is when $2(k-1006) = 2011 - k$ . Solving gives $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C)} 1341}$ .  Note 1 :\n",
      "We claim that $0 < a_1 < a_3 < ... < a_{2011} < a_{2010} < ... < a_4 < a_2 < 1$ . We can use induction to prove this statement. (not necessary for AMC): Base Case: We have already shown the base case above, where $0 < a_1 < a_2 < 1$ . Inductive Step: Rearranging in decreasing order gives $1 > b_1 = a_2 > b_2 = a_4 > ... > b_{1005} = a_{2010} > b_{1006} = a_{2011} > ... > b_{2010} = a_3 > b_{2011} =  a_1 > 0$ . Start by looking at the first few terms and comparing them to each other. We can see that $a_1 < a_2$ , and that $a_1 < a_3 < a_2$ , and that $a_3 < a_4 < a_2$ , and that $a_3 < a_5 < a_4$ ... From this, we find the pattern that $a_{k-1} < a_{k+1} < a_k$ . Examining this relationship, we see that every new number $a_k$ will be between the previous two terms, $a_{k-1}$ and $a_{k-2}$ . Therefore, we can see that $a_1$ is the smallest number, $a_2$ is the largest number, and that all odd terms are less than even terms. Furthermore, we can see that for every odd k, $a_k < a_{k+2}$ , and for every even k, $a_k > a_{k+2}$  This means that rearranging the terms in descending order will first have all the even terms from $a_2$ to $a_{2012}$ , in that order, and then all odd terms from $a_{2011}$ to $a_1$ , in that order (so $\\{b_k\\}_{k=1}^{2011} = {a_2, a_4, a_6, ... a_{2008}, a_{2010}, a_{2011}, a_{2009}, ... a_5, a_3, a_1}$ ). We can clearly see that there will be no solution k where k is even, as the $k$ th term in $\\{a_k\\}_{k=1}^{2011}$ will appear in the same position in its sequence as the $2k$ th term does in $\\{a_k\\}_{k=1}^{2011}$ , where k is even. Therefore, we only have to look at the odd terms of $a_k$ , which occur in the latter part of $b_k$ . Looking at the back of both sequences, we see that term k in $\\{a_k\\}_{k=1}^{2011}$ progresses backwards in the equation $2012 - k$ , and that term k in $\\{a_k\\}_{k=1}^{2011}$ progresses backwards in the equation $2k - 1$ . Setting these two expressions equal to each other, we get $671$ . However, remember that we started counting from the back of both sequences. So, plugging $671$ back into either side of the equation from earlier, we get our answer of $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C)} 1341}$ . Sorry for the sloppy explanation. It's been two years since I've tried to give a solution to a problem, and this is the first time I've really used \\LaTeX.

      " Our goal is to determine how many times the graph of $nf(xf(x))=x$ intersects the graph of $y=x$ . We begin by analyzing the behavior of $\\{x\\}$ . It increases linearly with a slope of one, then when it reaches the next integer, it repeats itself. We can deduce that the function is like a sawtooth wave, with a period of one. We then analyze the function $f(x)=|2\\{x\\}-1|$ . The slope of the teeth is multiplied by 2 to get 2, and the function is moved one unit downward. The function can then be described as starting at -1, moving upward with a slope of 2 to get to 1, and then repeating itself, still with a period of 1. The absolute value of the function is then taken. This results in all the negative segments becoming flipped in the Y direction. The positive slope starting at -1 of the function ranging from $u$ to $u.5$ , where u is any arbitrary integer, is now a negative slope starting at positive 1.   The function now looks like the letter V repeated within every square in the first row. It is now that we address the goal of this, which is to determine how many times the function intersects the line $y=x$ . Since there are two line segments per box, the function has two chances to intersect the line $y=x$ for every integer. If the height of the function is higher than $y=x$ for every integer on an interval, then every chance within that interval intersects the line. Returning to analyzing the function, we note that it is multiplied by $x$ , and then fed into $f(x)$ . Since $f(x)$ is a periodic function, we can model it as multiplying the function's frequency by $x$ . This gives us $2x$ chances for every integer, which is then multiplied by 2 once more to get $4x$ chances for every integer. The amplitude of this function is initially 1, and then it is multiplied by $n$ , to give an amplitude of $n$ . The function intersects the line $y=x$ for every chance in the interval of $0\\leq x \\leq n$ , since the function is n units high. The function ceases to intersect $y=x$ when $n < x$ , since the height of the function is lower than $y=x$ . The number of times the function intersects $y=x$ is then therefore equal to $4+8+12...+4n$ . We want this sum to be greater than 2012 which occurs when $n=32$ (C) . https://artofproblemsolving.com/videos/amc/2012amc12a/256  ~dolphin7\n",

      " We can count the number of possible foods for each day and then multiply to enumerate the number of combinations. On Friday, we have one possibility: cake. On Saturday, we have three possibilities: pie, ice cream, or pudding. This is the end of the week. On Thursday, we have three possibilities: pie, ice cream, or pudding. We can't have cake because we have to have cake the following day, which is the Friday with the birthday party. On Wednesday, we have three possibilities: cake, plus the two things that were not eaten on Thursday. Similarly, on Tuesday, we have three possibilities: the three things that were not eaten on Wednesday. Likewise on Monday: three possibilities, the three things that were not eaten on Tuesday. On Sunday, it is tempting to think there are four possibilities, but remember that cake must be served on Friday. This serves to limit the number of foods we can eat on Sunday, with the result being that there are three possibilities: The three things that were not eaten on Monday. So the number of menus is $3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 3 = 729.$ The answer is $\\boxed{A}$ . We can perform casework as an understandable means of getting the answer. We can organize our counting based on the food that was served on Wednesday, because whether cake is or is not served on Wednesday seems to significantly affect the number of ways the chef can make said foods for that week. Case 1: Cake is served on Wednesday. Here, we have three choices for food on Thursday and Saturday since cake must be served on Friday, and none of these choices are cake, which was served Wednesday. Likewise, we have three choices (pie, ice cream, and pudding) for the food served on Tuesday and thus three choices for those served on Monday and Sunday, with these three choices being whatever was not served on Tuesday and Monday, respectively. Hence, for this case, there are $3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 3 = 243$ possibilities. Case 2: Cake is not served on Wednesday. Obviously, this means that pie, ice cream, and pudding are our only choices for Wednesday's food. Since cake must be served on Friday, only ice cream, pudding, and cake can be served on Thursday. However, since one of those foods was chosen for Wednesday, we only have two possibilities for Thursday's food. Like our first case, we have three possibilities for the food served on Tuesday, Monday, and Sunday: whatever was not served on Wednesday, Tuesday, and Monday, respectively. $3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 = 486$ possibilities thus exist for this case. Adding the number of possibilities together yields that $243 + 486 = 729$ is the total number of menus, making our answer $\\boxed{A}$ . Note that the choice of a food item on a given day is symmetric, i.e. the number of ways to create the meal plan with a cake on Friday is the same as the number of ways to create the meal plan with pudding on Friday, and the same reasoning holds for the other desserts. Since every meal plan is counted by the summation of the $4$ aforementioned plans (note that Friday's dessert has to be one of the $4$ given desserts) and that these cases are mutually exclusive (i.e. you cannot make both a cake and pudding on Friday), each case results in a quarter of the total meal plans (Since there are $4$ desserts, we multiply by $\\tfrac{1}{4}$ ). The total number of plans with no restrictions can be counted with constructive counting, as follows: We note that there are $4$ ways to choose the first dessert. Then, each dessert thereafter must be distinct from the prior one. Since there are $4$ options, and $1$ of them has been taken by the prior, each following dessert can be chosen in $(4 - 1) = 3$ ways. Thus, since there are $6$ desserts other than the first, the total number (without restrictions) is $4 \\cdot 3^6$  Thus, by our symmetry argument derived prior, we know that the number of desired meal plans is $\\frac{\\text{\\# plans w/o restrictions}}{4} = \\frac{4 \\cdot 3^6}{4} = 3^6 = 729$ , choice $\\boxed{A}$  ~ftwmaster65\n",

      " Solution 1 There are $\\binom{20}{2}$ selections; however, we count these twice, therefore $2\\cdot\\binom{20}{2} = \\boxed{\\textbf{(D)}\\ 380}$ . The wording of the question implies D, not E. However, MAA decided to accept both D and E. Solution 2 Consider the 20 term sequence of $0$ 's and $1$ 's.  Keeping all other terms 1, a sequence of $k>0$ consecutive 0's can be placed in $21-k$ locations. That is, there are 20 strings with 1 zero, 19 strings with 2 consecutive zeros, 18 strings with 3 consecutive zeros, ..., 1 string with 20 consecutive zeros. Hence there are $20+19+\\cdots+1=\\binom{21}{2}$ strings with consecutive zeros. The same argument shows there are $\\binom{21}{2}$ strings with consecutive 1's. This yields $2\\binom{21}{2}$ strings in all. However, we have counted twice those strings in which all the 1's and all the 0's are consecutive. These are the cases $01111...$ , $00111...$ , $000111...$ , ..., $000...0001$ (of which there are 19) as well as the cases $10000...$ , $11000...$ , $111000...$ , ..., $111...110$ (of which there are 19 as well). This yields $2\\binom{21}{2}-2\\cdot19=\\boxed{\\textbf{(E)}\\ 382}$  First, we think of ways to make all the $1$ 's consecutive. If there are no consecutive $1$ 's, there are $\\binom{20}{0}$ ways to order them. If there is one consecutive $1$ , there are $\\binom{20}{1}$ ways to order them. If there are two consecutive $1$ 's, then there are $\\binom{19}{1}$ ways to order them (We treat the two $1$ 's like a block, and then order that block with 18 other $0$ 's). Continuing in this fashion, there are $\\binom{20}{0} + \\binom{20}{1} + \\binom{19}{1} + \\cdots + \\binom{1}{1} = 1 + 20 + 19 + \\cdots + 2 + 1 = 210 + 1 = 211$ ways to order consecutive $1$ 's. From symmetry, there are also $211$ ways to order the $0$ 's. Now, from PIE, we subtract out the cases where both the $1$ 's and the $0$ 's are consecutive. We do this because when counting the ways to order the $1$ 's, we counted all of these cases once. Then, we did so again when ordering the $0$ 's. So, to only have all of these cases once, we must subtract them. If $1$ is the leftmost digit, then there are $20$ cases where all the $1$ 's and $0$ 's are consecutive (we basically are choosing how many $1$ 's are consecutive, and there are $20$ possibilities. All other digits become $0$ , which are automatically consecutive since the $1$ 's are consecutive. There are also $20$ cases when $0$ is the left-most digit. Thus, there are a total of $211 + 211 - 20 - 20 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(E)}\\ 382}$ . But, from the way the problem is worded, it somewhat implies that the orderings must include both $1$ 's and $0$ 's, so the answer would then be $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D)}\\ 380}$ after we subtract out the cases where the orderings are either all $1$ 's or all $0$ 's. But, since this is unclear, MAA accepted both $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D}\\ 380}$ and $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E)}\\ 382}$ as acceptable answers.  Solution 4 We consider two cases, and subtract their overcount.

If we invert the $0$ s to $1$ s, we similarly have $20$ more ways, hence we need to subtract $40$ from our total count.

If $a$ cannot equal $c$ , then there is always a solution, but if $a=c$ , a $1$ in $6$ chance, leaving a $1080$ out $1296$ , always having at least one point in common. And if $a=c$ , then the only way for that to work, is if $d=b$ , a $1$ in $36$ chance, however, this can occur $6$ ways, so a $1$ in $6$ chance of this happening. So adding one  thirty sixth to $\\frac{1080}{1296}$ , we get the simplified fraction of $\\frac{31}{36}$ ; answer $\\boxed{(D)}$ . Solution 2 Proceed as above to obtain $x(a-c)=d-b$ .

Imagine the two sides as lines - they will have no solutions when the two lines are parallel (eg. have the same gradient) which is when $a$ is not equal to $c$ . Also, if $b = d$ and $a = c$ , they're the same line so we must add one case. There are $36$ combinations of $a$ and $c$ , of which they are equal in $6$ - but we must subtract 1 as if $a=c$ but $b=d$ they still intersect and have solutions.

      " Solution 1 Let the ordered triple $(a,b,c)$ denote that $a$ songs are liked by Amy and Beth, $b$ songs by Beth and Jo, and $c$ songs by Jo and Amy. The only possible triples are $(1,1,1), (2,1,1), (1,2,1)(1,1,2)$ . To show this, observe these are all valid conditions. Second, note that none of $a,b,c$ can be bigger than 3. Suppose otherwise, that $a = 3$ . Without loss of generality, say that Amy and Beth like songs 1, 2, and 3. Then because there is at least one song liked by each pair of girls, we require either $b$ or $c$ to be at least 1. In fact, we require either $b$ or $c$ to equal 1, otherwise there will be a song liked by all three. Suppose $b = 1$ . Then we must have $c=0$ since no song is liked by all three girls, a contradiction. Case 1 : How many ways are there for $(a,b,c)$ to equal $(1,1,1)$ ? There are 4 choices for which song is liked by Amy and Beth, 3 choices for which song is liked by Beth and Jo, and 2 choices for which song is liked by Jo and Amy. The fourth song can be liked by only one of the girls, or none of the girls, for a total of 4 choices. So $(a,b,c)=(1,1,1)$ in $4\\cdot3\\cdot2\\cdot4 = 96$ ways. Case 2 : To find the number of ways for $(a,b,c) = (2,1,1)$ , observe there are $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ choices of songs for the first pair of girls. There remain 2 choices of songs for the next pair (who only like one song). The last song is given to the last pair of girls. But observe that we let any three pairs of the girls like two songs, so we multiply by 3. In this case there are $6\\cdot2\\cdot3=36$ ways for the girls to like the songs. That gives a total of $96 + 36 = 132$ ways for the girls to like the songs, so the answer is $\\boxed{(\\textrm{\\textbf{B}})}$ . Solution 2 Let $AB, BJ$ , and $AJ$ denote a song that is liked by Amy and Beth (but not Jo), Beth and Jo (but not Amy), and Amy and Jo (but not Beth), respectively. Similarly, let $A, B, J,$ and $N$ denote a song that is liked by only Amy, only Beth, only Jo, and none of them, respectively. Since we know that there is at least $1\\: AB, BJ$ , and $AJ$ , they must be $3$ songs out of the $4$ that Amy, Beth, and Jo listened to. The fourth song can be of any type $N, A, B, J, AB, BJ$ , and $AJ$ (there is no $ABJ$ because no song is liked by all three, as stated in the problem.) Therefore, we must find the number of ways to rearrange $AB, BJ, AJ$ , and a song from the set $\\{N, A, B, J, AB, BJ, AJ\\}$ . Case 1: Fourth song = $N, A, B, J$  Note that in Case 1, all four of the choices for the fourth song are different from the first three songs. Number of ways to rearrange = $(4!)$ rearrangements for each choice $*\\: 4$ choices = $96$ . Case 2: Fourth song = $AB, BJ, AJ$  Note that in Case $2$ , all three of the choices for the fourth song repeat somewhere in the first three songs. Number of ways to rearrange = $(4!/2!)$ rearrangements for each choice $*\\: 3$ choices = $36$ . $96 + 36 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(B)} \\: 132}$ . Solution 3 There are $\\binom{4}{3}$ ways to choose the three songs that are liked by the three pairs of girls. There are $3!$ ways to determine how the three songs are liked, or which song is liked by which pair of girls. In total, there are $\\binom{4}{3}\\cdot3!$ possibilities for the first $3$ songs. There are $3$ cases for the 4th song, call it song D. Case $1$ : D is disliked by all $3$ girls $\\implies$ there is only $1$ possibility. Case $2$ : D is liked by exactly $1$ girl $\\implies$ there are $3$ possibility. Case $3$ : D is liked by exactly $2$ girls $\\implies$ there are $3$ pairs of girls to choose from. However, there's overlap when the other song liked by the same pair of girl is counted as the 4th song at some point, in which case D would be counted as one of the first $3$ songs liked by the same girls. Counting the overlaps, there are $3$ ways to choose the pair with overlaps and $4\\cdot3=12$ ways to choose what the other $2$ pairs like independently. In total, there are $3\\cdot12=36$ overlapped possibilities. Finally, there are $\\binom{4}{3}\\cdot3!\\cdot(3+1+3)-36=132$ ways for the songs to be likely by the girls. $\\boxed{\\mathrm{(B)}}$  ~ Nafer Solution 4 This is a bipartite graph problem, with the girls as left vertices and songs as right vertices. An edge connecting left vertex and right vertex means that a girl likes a song. Condition 1: \"No song is liked by all three\", means that the degree of right vertices is at most 2. Condition 2: \"for each of the three pairs of the girls, there is at least one song liked by those two girls but disliked by the third\", means that for any pair of left vertices, there is at least a right vertex connecting to them. To meet condition 2, there are at least 3 right vertices with 2 edges connecting to left vertices.  There are 2 cases: Case 1: there are only 3 such right vertices. There are $\\binom{4}{3}$ such vertices, with $3!$ ways of connections to the left vertices, total arrangements are $\\binom{4}{3}\\cdot3! = 24$ . The fourth right vertex either has no edge to the 3 left vertices, or 1 edge to 1 of the 3 left vertices.  So there are $24\\cdot(1+3) = 96$ ways. Case 2: there are 4 such right vertices, 2 of them have edges to the same pair of left vertices.  There are $\\binom{4}{2}$ such vertices, with $3!$ ways of connections.  So there are $\\binom{4}{2}\\cdot3! = 36$ ways. Total ways are $96+36=132$ . Another way is to overcount then subtract overlap ways.  Similar to previous case 1,  the fourth right vertex could have all possible connection to the left vertices except connecting to all 3, so it is $2^3-1=7$ ways, so the total ways are $\\binom{4}{3}\\cdot3!\\cdot7 = 24\\cdot7 = 168$ .  But this overcounts the case 2 with 36 ways.  So total ways are $168-36=132$ . - junche  https://artofproblemsolving.com/videos/amc/2012amc10b/272  ~dolphin7 Let's assign to each of the 3 pairs a song that they like, and that song is disliked by the other girl(satisfy the problem's 2nd condition). The first pair has 4 choice, 2nd has 3 choice, and last one has 2 choice. $4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2$ . Then the last song can be liked/disliked freely, so there is $2^3 = 8$ total ways they can like/dislike the songs. Of these 8 cases, one of them is when they all like the song (which isn't allowed by the problem), so we subtract it away to have 7 cases. $4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 7 = 168$ . But, we have overcounts when one pair of girls likes 2 songs, and the other girl dislikes those 2 songs. We can find the amount of cases that this happens by giving 1 pair of girls 2 songs that they like (and the other dislikes), and the other 2 pairs of girls 1 song that they like. There are 3 pairs of girls that we can choose to like 2 songs, so there are $3 \\cdot \\left(\\binom {4}{2} \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1\\right) = 36$ ways. $168 - 36 = \\boxed {\\textbf{(B) 132}}$ . ~heheman\n",

Also construct points $G$ and $H$ as in the diagram so that $BG\\parallel PQ$ and $CH\\parallel QR$ . Observe that $\\triangle AGB\\sim\\triangle CHD$ while $PQRS$ being a square implies that $GB=CH$ . Furthermore, $CD=6=3\\cdot AB$ , so $\\triangle CHD$ is 3 times bigger than $\\triangle AGB$ . Therefore, $HD=3\\cdot GB=3\\cdot HC$ . In other words, the longer leg is 3 times the shorter leg in any triangle similar to $\\triangle AGB$ . Let $K$ be the foot of the perpendicular from $M$ to $EF$ , and let $x=EK$ . Triangles $\\triangle EKM$ and $\\triangle MKF$ , being similar to $\\triangle AGB$ , also have legs in a 1:3 ratio, therefore, $MK=3x$ and $KF=9x$ , so $10x=EF=6$ . It follows that $EK=0.6$ and $MK=1.8$ , so the coordinates of $M$ are $(4+0.6,1.8)=(4.6,1.8)$ and so our answer is $4.6+1.8 = 6.4 =$  $\\boxed{\\mathbf{(C)}\\ 32/5}$ .

Let the lines that go through each point be labeled $L_1$ , $L_2$ , $L_3$ , and $L_4$ , respectively. Since $L_1$ and $L_2$ go through $SP$ and $RQ$ , respectively, and $SP$ and $RQ$ are opposite sides of the square, we can say that $L_1$ and $L_2$ are parallel with slope $m$ . Similarly, $L_3$ and $L_4$ have slope $-\\frac{1}{m}$ . Also, note that since square $PQRS$ lies in the first quadrant, $L_1$ and $L_2$ must have a positive slope. Using the point-slope form, we can now find the equations of all four lines: $L_1: y = m(x-3)$ , $L_2: y = m(x-5)$ , $L_3: y = -\\frac{1}{m}(x-7)$ , $L_4: y = -\\frac{1}{m}(x-13)$ . Since $PQRS$ is a square, it follows that $\\Delta x$ between points $P$ and $Q$ is equal to $\\Delta y$ between points $Q$ and $R$ . Our approach will be to find $\\Delta x$ and $\\Delta y$ in terms of $m$ and equate the two to solve for $m$ . $L_1$ and $L_3$ intersect at point $P$ . Setting the equations for $L_1$ and $L_3$ equal to each other and solving for $x$ , we find that they intersect at $x = \\frac{3m^2 + 7}{m^2 + 1}$ . $L_2$ and $L_3$ intersect at point $Q$ . Intersecting the two equations, the $x$ -coordinate of point $Q$ is found to be $x = \\frac{5m^2 + 7}{m^2 + 1}$ . Subtracting the two, we get $\\Delta x = \\frac{2m^2}{m^2 + 1}$ . Substituting the $x$ -coordinate for point $Q$ found above into the equation for $L_2$ , we find that the $y$ -coordinate of point $Q$ is $y = \\frac{2m}{m^2+1}$ . $L_2$ and $L_4$ intersect at point $R$ . Intersecting the two equations, the $y$ -coordinate of point $R$ is found to be $y = \\frac{8m}{m^2 + 1}$ . Subtracting the two, we get $\\Delta y = \\frac{6m}{m^2 + 1}$ . Equating $\\Delta x$ and $\\Delta y$ , we get $2m^2 = 6m$ which gives us $m = 3$ . Finally, note that the line which goes though the midpoint of $P_1$ and $P_2$ with slope $3$ and the line which goes through the midpoint of $P_3$ and $P_4$ with slope $-\\frac{1}{3}$ must intersect at at the center of the square. The equation of the line going through $(4,0)$ is given by $y = 3(x-4)$ and the equation of the line going through $(10,0)$ is $y = -\\frac{1}{3}(x-10)$ . Equating the two, we find that they intersect at $(4.6, 1.8)$ . Adding the $x$ and $y$ -coordinates, we get $6.4 = 32/5$ . Thus, answer choice $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C)}}$ is correct. Note that the center of the square lies along a line that has an $x-$ intercept of $\\frac{3+5}{2}=4$ , and also along another line with $x-$ intercept $\\frac{7+13}{2}=10$ . Since these 2 lines are parallel to the sides of the square, they are perpendicular (since the sides of a square are). Let $m$ be the slope of the first line. Then $-\\frac{1}{m}$ is the slope of the second line. We may use the point-slope form for the equation of a line to write $l_1:y=m(x-4)$ and $l_2:y=-\\frac{1}{m}(x-10)$ . We easily calculate the intersection of these lines using substitution or elimination to obtain $\\left(\\frac{4m^2+10}{m^2+1},\\frac{6m}{m^2+1}\\right)$ as the center or the square. Let $\\theta$ denote the (acute) angle formed by $l_1$ and the $x-$ axis. Note that $\\tan\\theta=m$ . Let $s$ denote the side length of the square. Then $\\sin\\theta=s/2$ . On the other hand the acute angle formed by $l_2$ and the $x-$ axis is $90-\\theta$ so that $\\cos\\theta=\\sin(90-\\theta)=s/6$ . Then $m=\\tan\\theta=3$ . Substituting into $\\left(\\frac{4m^2+10}{m^2+1},\\frac{6m}{m^2+1}\\right)$ we obtain $\\left(\\frac{23}{5},\\frac{9}{5}\\right)$ so that the sum of the coordinates is $\\frac{32}{5}=6.4$ . Hence the answer is $\\framebox{C}$ . Suppose \\[SP: y=m(x-3)\\]  \\[RQ: y=m(x-5)\\]  \\[PQ: -my=x-7\\]  \\[SR: -my=x-13\\]  where $m >0$ . Recall that the distance between two parallel lines $Ax+By+C=0$ and $Ax+By+C_1=0$ is $|C-C_1|/\\sqrt{A^2+B^2}$ , we have distance between $SP$ and $RQ$ equals to $2m/\\sqrt{1+m^2}$ , and the distance between $PQ$ and $SR$ equals to $6/\\sqrt{1+m^2}$ . Equating them, we get $m=3$ . Then, the center of the square is just the intersection between the following two \"mid\" lines: \\[L_1: y=3(x-4)\\]  \\[L_2: -3y = x-10\\]  The solution is $(4.6,1.8)$ , so we get the answer $4.6+1.8=6.4$ . $\\framebox{C}$ . Using the diagram shown in Solution 1, we can set angle $BCQ$ as $\\theta$ . We know that $AB=2$ and $BC=2$ . Now using $AA$  similarity, we know that $\\triangle BCQ\\sim\\triangle ACP$ in a $1:2$ ratio. Now we can see that $CQ=-2$ $\\cos\\theta$ , therefore, meaning that $PQ=-2$ $\\cos\\theta$ . $PQRS$ is a square, so $QR=-2$ $\\cos\\theta$ . We also know that $QCHR$ is also a square since its angles are $90^\\circ$ and all of its sides are equal. Because squares $PQRS$ and $QCHR$ have equal side lengths, they are congruent leading to the conclusion that side $CH=-2$ $\\cos\\theta$ . Since $PQRS$ is a square, lines $PQ$ and $SR$ are parallel meaning that angle $CDH$ and angle $BCQ$ are congruent. We can easily calculate that the length of $CD=6$ and furthermore that $CH=6$ $\\sin\\theta$ . Setting $6\\sin\\theta=-2\\cos\\theta$ , we get that $\\tan\\theta=-1/3$ . This means $-1/3$ is the slope of line $PQ$  and the lines parallel to it. This is good news because we are dealing with easy numbers. We can solve for the coordinates of points $E$ and $F$ because they are the midpoints. This will make solving for the center of square $PQRS$ easier. $E=(4,0)$ and $F=(10,0)$ . We know the slopes of lines $MF$ and $ME$ , which are $-1/3$ and $3$ respectively. Now we can get the two equations. \\[\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}y=-1/3x+10/3\\\\y=3x-12\\end{array}\\right.\\]  By solving: $-1/3x+10/3=3x-12,$ we find that $x=4.6$ . Then plugging $x$ back into one of the first equations, we can find $y$ and the final coordinate turns out to be $(4.6,1.8)$ . Summing up the values of $x$ and $y$ , you get $4.6+1.8=6.4=32/5$ . $\\boxed{\\mathbf{(C)}\\ 32/5}$ . ~kempwood [asy] size(14cm); pair A=(3,0),B=(5,0),C=(7,0),D=(13,0),EE=(4,0),F=(10,0),P=(3.4,1.2),Q=(5.2,0.6),R=(5.8,2.4),SS=(4,3),M=(4.6,1.8),G=(3.2,0.6),H=(7.6,1.8);  dot(A^^B^^C^^D^^EE^^F^^P^^Q^^R^^SS^^M^^G^^H); draw(A--SS--D--cycle); draw(P--Q--R^^B--Q--C); draw(EE--M--F^^G--B^^C--H,dotted);  label(\"A\",A,SW); label(\"B\",B,S); label(\"C\",C,S); label(\"D\",D,SE); label(\"E\",EE,S); label(\"F\",F,S); label(\"P\",P,W); label(\"Q\",Q,NW); label(\"R\",R,NE); label(\"S\",SS,N); label(\"M\",M,S); label(\"G\",G,W); label(\"H\",H,NE);[/asy]  $SP: y = mx - 3m$ , $RQ: y = mx-5m$ , $PQ: y = -\\frac{1}{m}x + \\frac{7}{m}$ , $SR: y = -\\frac{1}{m}x + \\frac{13}{m}$  Let $SP = RP = PQ = SR = a$ , $\\angle GAB = \\angle HCD = \\theta$ , and the slope of $SP$ be $m$ .

      " 2012 AMC-12B-19.jpg  Observe the diagram above. Each dot represents one of the six vertices of the regular octahedron. Three dots have been placed exactly x units from the $(0,0,0)$ corner of the unit cube. The other three dots have been placed exactly x units from the $(1,1,1)$ corner of the unit cube. A red square has been drawn connecting four of the dots to provide perspective regarding the shape of the octahedron. Observe that the three dots that are near $(0,0,0)$ are each $(x)(\\sqrt{2}$ ) from each other. The same is true for the three dots that are near $(1,1,1).$ There is a unique $x$ for which the rectangle drawn in red becomes a square. This will occur when the distance from $(x,0,0)$ to $(1,1-x, 1)$ is $(x)(\\sqrt{2}$ ). Using the distance formula we find the distance between the two points to be: $\\sqrt{{(1-x)^2} + {(1-x)^2} + 1}$ = $\\sqrt{2x^2 - 4x +3}$ . Equating this to $(x)(\\sqrt{2}$ ) and squaring both sides, we have the equation: $2{x^2} - 4x + 3$ = $2{x^2}$  $-4x + 3 = 0$  $x$ = $\\frac{3} {4}$ . Since the length of each side is $(x)(\\sqrt{2}$ ), we have a final result of $\\frac{3 \\sqrt{2}}{4}$ . Thus, Answer choice $\\boxed{\\text{A}}$ is correct.

Let the tip of the octahedron on side $P_1P_3$ be $K_1$ and the opposite vertex be $K_2$ . Our key is to examine the trapezoid $P_1K_1K_2P_3$ . Let the side length of the octahedron be $s$ . Then $P_1K_1 = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{2}}$ and $P_3K_2 = 1 - \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{2}}$ . Then, we have $P_1P_3 = \\sqrt{2}$ . Finally, we want to find $K_1K_2$ , which is just double the height of half the octahedron. We can use Pythagorean Theorem to find that height as $\\sqrt{2}s$ . Now, we use the Pythagorean Theorem on the trapezoid.

      " Name the trapezoid $ABCD$ , where $AB$ is parallel to $CD$ , $AB<CD$ , and $AD<BC$ . Draw a line through $B$ parallel to $AD$ , crossing the side $CD$ at $E$ . Then $BE=AD$ , $EC=DC-DE=DC-AB$ . One needs to guarantee that $BE+EC>BC$ , so there are only three possible trapezoids: \\[AB=3, BC=7, CD=11, DA=5, CE=8\\]  \\[AB=5, BC=7, CD=11, DA=3, CE=6\\]  \\[AB=7, BC=5, CD=11, DA=3, CE=4\\]  In the first case, by Law of Cosines, $\\cos(\\angle BCD) = (8^2+7^2-5^2)/(2\\cdot 7\\cdot 8) = 11/14$ , so $\\sin (\\angle BCD) = \\sqrt{1-121/196} = 5\\sqrt{3}/14$ . Therefore the area of this trapezoid is $\\frac{1}{2} (3+11) \\cdot 7 \\cdot 5\\sqrt{3}/14 = \\frac{35}{2}\\sqrt{3}$ . In the second case, $\\cos(\\angle BCD) = (6^2+7^2-3^2)/(2\\cdot 6\\cdot 7) = 19/21$ , so $\\sin (\\angle BCD) = \\sqrt{1-361/441} = 4\\sqrt{5}/21$ . Therefore the area of this trapezoid is $\\frac{1}{2} (5+11) \\cdot 7 \\cdot 4\\sqrt{5}/21 =\\frac{32}{3}\\sqrt{5}$ . In the third case, $\\angle BCD = 90^{\\circ}$ , therefore the area of this trapezoid is $\\frac{1}{2} (7+11) \\cdot 3 = 27$ . So $r_1 + r_2 + r_3 + n_1 + n_2 = 17.5 + 10.666... + 27 + 3 + 5$ , which rounds down to $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D)}\\ 63}$ . 2012AMC12BProblem20Solution2.PNG Let the area of the trapezoid be $S$ , the area of the triangle be $S_1$ , the area of the parallelogram be $S_2$ .

If the bug passes through the white arrow, the red arrow that the bug travels through must be the closest to the first black arrow. Otherwise, the bug will have to travel through both red segments, which is impossible because now there is no path to take after the bug emerges from the reverse arrow.  Similarly, with the blue segments, the second black arrow taken must be the one that is closest to the blue arrow that was taken.  Also, it is trivial that the two black arrows taken must be different.  Therefore, if the reverse arrow is taken, the blue arrow taken determines the entire path and there is $1$ path for every arrow.  Since the bug cannot return once it takes a blue arrow, the answer must be divisible by $5$ . $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E)}\\ 2400}$ is the only answer that is. We use casework. \n",
      "The main thing to notice is that, if the bug does not go backwards, then every vertical set of arrows can be used, as the bug could travel straight downwards and then use any arrow to continue right. Note: The motivation is quite weird so follow my numbers as they start from the left (point A) and go right (point B). Case 1: Bug does not go backwards. The number of cases for this is just each vertical set of arrows multiplied to each other (if you don't understand where I'm coming from, try to understand where these numbers come from!) And so we have $2*2*4*4*4*2*2 = 2^{10}$ cases. Case 2: The bug goes backwards once, either at the first arrow or third arrow. Here, we have to count the fact that there is a horizontal midline that the bug could not cross, or otherwise it would be stepping on the same edge twice.\n",
      "Back on first arrow: $2*1*2*4*4*2*2 = 2^{8}$ cases.\n",
      "Back on third arrow: $2*2*4*4*4*1 = 2^{8}$ cases. Case 3: The bug goes backwards once, at the second arrow. Same thing as above, except since there are 4 arrows in the vertical set (plus one for the backwards arrow), then the calculations are a bit different. We have $2*2*4*1*2*4*2*2 = 2^{9}$ cases. Notice that the first and third back arrows decrease the number of cases by a factor of $2^2$ and the second back arrow decreases the number of cases by $2^1$ . Hence, 1st + 2nd = $2^7$  2nd + 3rd = $2^7$  1st + 3rd = $2^6$  1st + 2nd + 3rd = $2^5$  And so the number of cases in total is $2^{10} + 2^9 + 2^8 + 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^7 + 2^6 + 2^5 \\Rightarrow 1024 + 512 + 256 + 256 + 128 + 128 + 64 + 32 = \\boxed{2400}$  Solution by IronicNinja  https://artofproblemsolving.com/videos/amc/2012amc10b/270  ~dolphin7 (Direct Youtube Link) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SE3hYHHYqhk \n",

      " Since $z_0$ is a root of $P$ , and $P$ has integer coefficients, $z_0$ must be algebraic. Since $z_0$ is algebraic and lies on the unit circle, $z_0$ must be a root of unity (Comment: this is not true. See this link: [1] ). Since $P$ has degree 4, it seems reasonable (and we will assume this only temporarily) that $z_0$ must be a 2nd, 3rd, or 4th root of unity. These are among the set $\\{\\pm1,\\pm i,(-1\\pm i\\sqrt{3})/2\\}$ . Since complex roots of polynomials come in conjugate pairs, we have that $P$ has one (or more) of the following factors: $z+1$ , $z-1$ , $z^2+1$ , or $z^2+z+1$ . If $z=1$ then $a+b+c+d+4=0$ ; a contradiction since $a,b,c,d$ are non-negative. On the other hand, suppose $z=-1$ . Then $(a+c)-(b+d)=4$ . This implies $a+b=8,7,6,5,4$ while $b+d=4,3,2,1,0$ correspondingly. After listing cases, the only such valid $a,b,c,d$ are $4,4,4,0$ , $4,3,3,0$ , $4,2,2,0$ , $4,1,1,0$ , and $4,0,0,0$ . Now suppose $z=i$ . Then $4=(a-c)i+(b-d)$ whereupon $a=c$ and $b-d=4$ . But then $a=b=c$ and $d=a-4$ . This gives only the cases $a,b,c,d$ equals $4,4,4,0$ , which we have already counted in a previous case. Suppose $z=-i$ . Then $4=i(c-a)+(b-d)$ so that $a=c$ and $b=4+d$ . This only gives rise to $a,b,c,d$ equal $4,4,4,0$ which we have previously counted. Finally suppose $z^2+z+1$ divides $P$ . Using polynomial division ((or that $z^3=1$ to make the same deductions) we ultimately obtain that $b=4+c$ . This can only happen if $a,b,c,d$ is $4,4,0,0$ . Hence we've the polynomials \\[4x^4+4x^3+4x^2+4x\\]  \\[4x^4+4x^3+3x^2+3x\\]  \\[4x^4+4x^3+2x^2+2x\\]  \\[4x^4+4x^3+x^2+x\\]  \\[4x^4+4x^3\\]  \\[4x^4+4x^3+4x^2\\] However, by inspection $4x^4+4x^3+4x^2+4x+4$ has roots on the unit circle, because $x^4+x^3+x^2+x+1=(x^5-1)/(x-1)$ which brings the sum to 92 (choice B).  Note that this polynomial has a 5th root of unity as a root. We will show that we were \\textit{almost} correct in our initial assumption; that is that $z_0$ is at most a 5th root of unity, and that the last polynomial we obtained is the last polynomial with the given properties. Suppose that $z_0$ in an $n$ th root of unity where $n>5$ , and $z_0$ is not a 3rd or 4th root of unity. (Note that 1st and 2nd roots of unity are themselves 4th roots of unity). If $n$ is prime, then \\textit{every} $n$ th root of unity except 1 must satisfy our polynomial, but since $n>5$ and the degree of our polynomial is 4, this is impossible. Suppose $n$ is composite. If it has a prime factor $p$ greater than 5 then again every $p$ th root of unity must satisfy our polynomial and we arrive at the same contradiction. Therefore suppose $n$ is divisible only by 2,3,or 5. Since by hypothesis $z_0$ is not a 2nd or 3rd root of unity, $z_0$ must be a 5th root of unity. Since 5 is prime, every 5th root of unity except 1 must satisfy our polynomial. That is, the other 4 complex 5th roots of unity must satisfy $P(z_0)=0$ . But $(x^5-1)/(x-1)$ has exactly all 5th roots of unity excluding 1, and $(x^5-1)/(x-1)=x^4+x^3+x^2+x+1$ . Thus this must divide $P$ which implies $P(x)=4(x^4+x^3+x^2+x+1)$ . This completes the proof. First, assume that $z_0\\in \\mathbb{R}$ , so $z_0=1$ or $-1$ . $1$ does not work because $P(1)\\geq 4$ . Assume that $z_0=-1$ . Then $0=P(-1)=4-a+b-c+d$ ,  we have $4+b+d=a+c\\leq 4+b$ , so $d=0$ . Also, $a=4$ has to be true since $4+b=a+c \\leq a+b$ . Now $4+b=4+c$ gives $b=c$ , therefore the only possible choices for $(a,b,c,d)$ are $(4,t,t,0)$ . In these cases, $P(-1)=4-4+t-t+0=0$ . The sum of $P(1)$ over these cases is $\\sum_{t=0}^{4} (4+4+t+t) = 40+20=60$ . Second, assume that $z_0\\in \\mathbb{C} \\backslash \\mathbb{R}$ , so $z_0=x_0+iy_0$ for some real $x_0, y_0$ , $|x_0|<1$ . By conjugate roots theorem we have that $P(z_0)=P(z_0^{*})=0$ , therefore $(z-z_0)(z-z_0^{*}) = (z^2 - 2x_0*z + 1)$ is a factor of $P(z)$ , and we may assume that \\[P(z) = (z^2-2x_0 z + 1)(4z^2 + pz + d)\\]  for some real $p$ . Expanding this polynomial and comparing the coefficients, we have the following equations: \\[p-8x_0 = a\\]  \\[d+4-2px_0 = b\\]  \\[p-2dx_0 = c\\]  From the first and the third we may deduce that $2x_0 = \\frac{a-c}{d-4}$ and that $p=\\frac{da-4c}{d-4}$ , if $d\\neq 4$ (we will consider $d=4$ by the end). Let $k=2px_0=\\frac{(a-c)(da-4c)}{(4-d)^2}$ . From the second equation, we know that $k=d+4-b$ is non-negative. Consider the following cases: Case 1: $a=c$ . Then $k=0$ , $b=d+4$ , so $a=b=c=4$ , $d=0$ . However, this has already been found (i.e. the form of $(4,t,t,0)$ ). Case 2: $a>c\\geq 0$ . Then since $k\\geq 0$ , we have $da-4c\\geq 0$ . However, $da \\leq 4c$ , therefore $da-4c=0$ . This is true only when $d=c$ . Also, we get $k=0$ again. In this case, $b=d+4$ , so $a=b=4$ , $c=d=0$ , $x_0=-1/2$ . $P(z)$ has a root $z_0=e^{i2\\pi/3}$ . $P(1)=12$ . Last case: $d=4$ . We have $a=b=c=d=4$ and that $P(z)$ has a root $z_0=e^{i2\\pi/5}$ . $P(1)=20$ . Therefore the desired sum is $60+12+20=92 ...\\framebox{B}$ . First, notice that $z=1$ cannot be a root of the polynomial because $a,b,c,d \\geq 0$ . Multiplying the polynomial by $(z-1)$ yields $P(z)(z-1) = 4z^5-(4-a)z^4-(a-b)z^3-(b-c)z^2-(c-d)z-d$ , so for $z \\neq 1$ to be a root of $P(z)$ , $4z^5 = (4-a)z^4+(a-b)z^3+(b-c)z^2+(c-d)z+d$ . Now we consider the root $z_0$ with $|z_0|=1$ . $|4z_0^5| = 4$ , so the right hand side must have absolute value 4. By the triangle inequality, $|(4-a)z_0^4+(a-b)z_0^3+(b-c)z_0^2+(c-d)z_0+d|$  $\\leq |(4-a)z_0^4|+|(a-b)z_0^3| + |(b-c)z_0^2| + |(c-d)z_0|+d$  $= (4-a)+(a-b)+(b-c)+(c-d)+d=4$ , with equality if and only if each of $4z_0^5$ , $(4-a)z_0^4$ , $(a-b)z_0^3$ , $(b-c)z_0^2$ , $(c-d)z_0$ , and $d$ is either zero or in the same direction as all the others when looked at as vectors in the complex plane. We can now divide into two cases: $d \\neq 0$ and $d=0$ . If $d \\neq 0$ , then $4z_0^5$ must be real by the previous argument, so $z_0$ is a fifth root of unity. Also, $(4-a)z_0^4$ , $(a-b)z_0^3$ , $(b-c)z_0^2$ , and $(c-d)z_0$ must all be zero because if $z_0$ is a fifth root of unity, none of these can be real numbers with positive absolute value. Therefore, $a=4$ , $b=a$ , $c=b$ , and $d=c$ , leading to the solution $(a,b,c,d)=(4,4,4,4)$ . Just to be sure, we can easily verify that this solution leads to the six complex numbers under question being in the same direction. If $d=0$ , then each of $4z_0^5$ , $(4-a)z_0^4$ , $(a-b)z_0^3$ , $(b-c)z_0^2$ , and $cz_0$ must either be zero or in the same direction as all the others, so each of $4z_0^4$ , $(4-a)z_0^3$ , $(a-b)z_0^2$ , $(b-c)z_0$ , and $c$ must either be zero or in the same direction as all the others. We can divide this into two cases: $c \\neq 0$ and $c=0$ . If $c \\neq 0$ , then $4z_0^4$ must be real. Then, $z_0$ is a fourth root of unity. If $z_0$ is not a second root of unity, $(4-a)z_0^3$ , $(a-b)z_0^2$ , and $(b-c)z_0$ must be zero, implying that $a=4$ , $b=a=4$ , and $c=b=4$ , leading to the solution $(a,b,c,d)=(4,4,4,0)$ . If $z_0$ is also a second root of unity, $(4-a)z_0^3$ and $(b-c)z_0$ must be zero but $(a-b)z_0^2$ can be anything. This implies $a=4$ and $b=c$ with no other restrictions, leading to the new solutions $(a,b,c,d) = (4,3,3,0), (4,2,2,0), (4,1,1,0), (4,0,0,0)$ . If $c=0$ , then we can similarly show that each of $4z_0^3$ , $(4-a)z_0^2$ , $(a-b)z_0$ , and $b$ must be zero or in the same direction as all the others. If $b \\neq 0$ , then $z_0$ must be a third root of unity, so $(4-a)z_0^2$ and $(a-b)z_0$ must be zero, implying $a=b=4$ , leading to the new solution $(a,b,c,d)=(4,4,0,0)$ . If $b=0$ , then we can similarly show that each of $4z_0^2$ , $(4-a)z_0$ , and $a$ must be zero or in the same direction as the others. For $|z_0|=1$ , $a = 4$ , but we have already counted the solution $(a,b,c,d)=(4,0,0,0)$ . Then, the complete list of solutions is $(a,b,c,d)=(4,4,4,4),(4,4,4,0),(4,3,3,0),(4,2,2,0),(4,1,1,0),(4,0,0,0),(4,4,0,0)$ , leading to a sum of $\\framebox{B}=92$ . https://artofproblemsolving.com/videos/amc/2012amc12b/278  ~dolphin7\n",

      " First of all, notice that for any odd prime $p$ , the largest prime that divides $p+1$ is no larger than $\\frac{p+1}{2}$ , therefore eventually the factorization of $f_k(N)$ does not contain any prime larger than $3$ . Also, note that $f_2(2^m) = f_1(3^{m-1})=2^{2m-4}$ , when $m=4$ it stays the same but when $m\\geq 5$ it grows indefinitely. Therefore any number $N$ that is divisible by $2^5$ or any number $N$ such that $f_k(N)$ is divisible by $2^5$ makes the sequence $(f_1(N),f_2(N),f_3(N),\\dots )$ unbounded. There are $12$ multiples of $2^5$ within $400$ . $2^4 5^2=400$ also works: $f_2(2^4 5^2) = f_1(3^4 \\cdot 2) = 2^6$ . Now let's look at the other cases. Any first power of prime in a prime factorization will not contribute the unboundedness because $f_1(p^1)=(p+1)^0=1$ . At least a square of prime is to contribute. So we test primes that are less than $\\sqrt{400}=20$ : $f_1(3^4)=4^3=2^6$ works, therefore any number $\\leq 400$ that are divisible by $3^4$ works: there are $4$ of them. $3^3 \\cdot Q^2$ could also work if $Q^2$ satisfies $2~|~f_1(Q^2)$ , but $3^3 \\cdot 5^2 > 400$ . $f_1(5^3)=6^2 = 2^2 3^2$ does not work. $f_1(7^3)=8^2=2^6$ works. There are no other multiples of $7^3$ within $400$ . $7^2 \\cdot Q^2$ could also work if $4~|~f_1(Q^2)$ , but $7^2 \\cdot 3^2 > 400$ already. For number that are only divisible by $p=11, 13, 17, 19$ , they don't work because none of these primes are such that $p+1$ could be a multiple of $2^5$ nor a multiple of $3^4$ . In conclusion, there are $12+1+4+1=18$ number of $N$ 's ... $\\framebox{D}$ . Say a number $n$ is $\\textit{boring}$ if the sequence $\\{f_k(n)\\}$ is bounded; otherwise $n$ is $\\textit{interesting}$ . It is clear that $n$ is interesting iff $f_1(n)$ is. For a prime, $p$ , $f_1(p)=1$ . Thus, for a prime, $p_k$ , in the prime factorization of $n$ ; if $e_k=1$ then $f_1(n)=f_1(n/p_k)$ , so $n$ is interesting iff $n/p_k$ is. Continuing in this manner, we can divide $n$ by all such primes $p_k$ for which $e_k=1$ ; and $n$ is interesting iff each of these resulting numbers are. Finally we will end up with a number  whose prime factorization  contains only exponents $\\ge 2$ . Let $S$ be the set of such numbers. It suffices to find all interesting numbers in $S$ ; all other interesting numbers will be multiples of these. Note that $f_1(n)\\mid f_1(kn)$ for all $k\\in\\mathbb{N}$ ; so by induction a multiple of an interesting number is also interesting. The set $S$ contains either powers of primes $\\le 19$ , or a product of two such powers. We have $f_2(2^a)=f_1(3^{a-1}) = 2^{2(a-2)}$ ; since $2(a-2)> a$ iff $a\\ge 5$ , so $2^5$ and its multiples are interesting; there are $12$ such. We have $f_2(3^b)=f_1(2^{2(b-1)}) = 3^{2b-3}$ ; since $2b-3> b$ iff $b\\ge 4$ , so $3^4$ and its multiples are interesting; there are $4$ such. Among the remaining prime powers only $7^3 \\textbf{ is interesting}$ but it has no other multiples in $[400]$ . We are now left with numbers $n\\in S$ that are products of two prime powers, i.e $n=p^aq^b$ , $a,b \\ge 2$ . We have $f_2(2^a3^b)= 2^{2(a-2)}3^{2b-3}$ , so a number of this form is interesting iff $a\\ge 5$ or $b\\ge 4$ ; they are already counted above. If $5^2\\mid n$ then $n=2^2\\cdot 5^2$ or $2^3\\cdot 5^2$ or $3^2\\cdot 5^2$ (all boring) or $n=2^4\\cdot 5^2=400$ , $\\textbf{which is interesting}$ , but has no other multiples. If $7^2\\mid n$ then $n$ is $2^2\\cdot 7^2$ or $2^3\\cdot 7^2$ and both are boring. No larger prime can divide $n$ because even $11^2\\cdot 2^2 > 400$ . We have found all the interesting numbers: $12$ multiples of $2^5$ , $4$ multiples of $3^4$ , $2^4\\cdot 5^2$ , and $7^3$ for a total of $12+4+1+1= 18$ ... $\\framebox{D}$ . https://artofproblemsolving.com/videos/amc/2012amc12b/276  ~dolphin7 \n",

      " Consider reflections. For any right triangle $ABC$ with the right labeling described in the problem, any reflection $A'B'C'$ labeled that way will give us $\\tan CBA \\cdot \\tan C'B'A' = 1$ . First we consider the reflection about the line $y=2.5$ . Only those triangles $\\subseteq T$ that have one vertex at $(0,5)$ do not reflect to a traingle $\\subseteq T$ . Within those triangles, consider a reflection about the line $y=5-x$ . Then only those triangles $\\subseteq T$ that have one vertex on the line $y=0$ do not reflect to a triangle $\\subseteq T$ . So we only need to look at right triangles that have vertices $(0,5), (*,0), (*,*)$ . There are three cases: Case 1: $A=(0,5)$ . Then $B=(*,0)$ is impossible. Case 2: $B=(0,5)$ .

      " Let the number of 3-point shots attempted be $x$ . Since she attempted 30 shots, the number of 2-point shots attempted must be $30 - x$ . Since she was successful on $20\\%$ , or $\\frac{1}{5}$ , of her 3-pointers, and $30\\%$ , or $\\frac{3}{10}$ , of her 2-pointers, then her score must be $\\frac{1}{5}*3x + \\frac{3}{10}*2(30-x)$   $\\frac{3}{5}*x + \\frac{3}{5}(30-x)$   $\\frac{3}{5}(x+30-x)$   $\\frac{3}{5}*30$   $18$ , which is $B$  Since the problem doesn't specify the number of 3-point shots she attempted, it can be assumed that number doesn't matter, so let it be $0$ . Then, she must have attempted $30$ 2-point shots. So, her score must be: $\\frac{3}{10}*30*2$ ,which is $B$ . (similar to Solution 1, however a slightly more obvious way) Say that x = # of 2-pt shots y = # of 3-pt shots Because the total number of shots is $30$ , $x + y = 30$  However, Shenille was only successful on $20\\%$ of the 3-pt shots, and $30\\%$ of the 2-pt shots, so $0.2x + 0.3y$ = #number of successful shots For each successful shot, there is an associated number of points with it. Therefore, $0.2(x)(3) + (0.3)(y)(2)$ = her score this evaluates to $0.6 (x + y)$ = her score $x + y$ is already determined to be 30, so her score is $0.6 (30) = \\boxed{\\textbf{(B)}\\ 18}$  ~amuppalla It is also reasonably easy to find all possibilities for the number of two-point and three-point shots she made. Just note that both numbers of successful throws have to be integers. For \" $30\\%$ of her two-point shots\" to be an integer we need the number of two-point shots to be divisible by 10. This only leaves four possibilities for the number of two-point shots: 0, 10, 20, or 30. Each of them also works for the three-point shots, and as shown above, for each of them the total number of points scored is the same. https://youtu.be/CCjcMVtkVaQ ~sugar_rush   2013 AMC 10A ( Problems • Answer Key • Resources )   Preceded by Problem 8   Followed by Problem 10    1  •  2  •  3  •  4  •  5  •  6  •  7  •  8  •  9  •  10  •  11  •  12  •  13  •  14  •  15  •  16  •  17  •  18  •  19  •  20  •  21  •  22  •  23  •  24  •  25    All AMC 10 Problems and Solutions    2013 AMC 12A ( Problems • Answer Key • Resources )   Preceded by Problem 5   Followed by Problem 7    1  •  2  •  3  •  4  •  5  •  6  •  7  •  8  •  9  •  10  •  11  •  12  •  13  •  14  •  15  •  16  •  17  •  18  •  19  •  20  •  21  •  22  •  23  •  24  •  25    All AMC 12 Problems and Solutions  The problems on this page are copyrighted by the Mathematical Association of America 's American Mathematics Competitions .

Dividing by 3 gives $\\frac{1}{33} = 0.\\overline{03}$ , and dividing by 9 gives $\\frac{1}{99} = 0.\\overline{01}$ . $S = \\{11, 33, 99\\}$  $11 + 33 + 99 = 143$  The answer must be at least $143$ , but cannot be $155$ since no $n \\le 12$ other than $11$ satisfies the conditions, so the answer is $143$ . Let us begin by working with the condition $0.\\overline{ab} = 0.ababab\\cdots,$ . Let $x = 0.ababab\\cdots$ . So, $100x-x = ab \\Rightarrow x = \\frac{ab}{99}$ . In order for this fraction $x$ to be in the form $\\frac{1}{n}$ , $99$ must be a multiple of $ab$ . Hence the possibilities of $ab$ are $1,3,9,11,33,99$ . Checking each of these, $\\frac{1}{99} = 0.\\overline{01}, \\frac{3}{99}=\\frac{1}{33} = 0.\\overline{03}, \\frac{9}{99}=\\frac{1}{11} = 0.\\overline{09}, \\frac{11}{99}=\\frac{1}{9} = 0.\\overline{1}, \\frac{33}{99} =\\frac{1}{3}= 0.\\overline{3},$ and $\\frac{99}{99} = 1$ . So the only values of $n$ that have distinct $a$ and $b$ are $11,33,$ and $99$ . So, $11+33+99= \\boxed{\\textbf{(D)} 143}$   Notice that we have $\\frac{100}{n}= ab.\\overline{ab}$  We can subtract $\\frac{1}{n}=00.\\overline{ab}$ to get \\[\\frac{99}{n}=ab\\]  From this we determine $n$ must be a positive factor of $99$  The factors of $99$ are $1,3,9,11,33,$ and $99$ . For $n=1,3,$ and $9$ however, they yield $ab=99,33$ and $11$ which doesn't satisfy $a$ and $b$ being distinct. For $n=11,33$ and $99$ we have $ab=09,03$ and $01$ .  (Notice that $a$ or $b$ can be zero) The sum of these $n$ are $11+33+99=143$  $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D)} 143}$   As in previous solutions, we have $n|99$ and $\\overline{ab} = 99/n$ . If we had $a=b$ , the decimal would be $0.\\overline{a}$ , which is characterized by $n|9$ and $a = 9/n$ . So we seek the sum of the factors of 99 that are not also factors of 9. Since $99 = 3^2 \\cdot 11$ , the sum is $(1 + 3 + 9)(1 + 11) - (1 + 3 + 9) = 13(12 - 1) = \\textbf{(D)} 143$ . https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpQaomC2tA  ~sugar_rush   2013 AMC 12A ( Problems • Answer Key • Resources )   Preceded by Problem 9   Followed by Problem 11    1  •  2  •  3  •  4  •  5  •  6  •  7  •  8  •  9  •  10  •  11  •  12  •  13  •  14  •  15  •  16  •  17  •  18  •  19  •  20  •  21  •  22  •  23  •  24  •  25    All AMC 12 Problems and Solutions  The problems on this page are copyrighted by the Mathematical Association of America 's American Mathematics Competitions .

      " Because the angles are in an arithmetic progression, and the angles add up to $180^{\\circ}$ , the second largest angle in the triangle must be $60^{\\circ}$ . Also, the side opposite of that angle must be the second longest because of the angle-side relationship. Any of the three sides, $4$ , $5$ , or $x$ , could be the second longest side of the triangle. The law of cosines can be applied to solve for $x$ in all three cases. When the second longest side is $5$ , we get that $5^2 = 4^2 + x^2 - 2(4)(x)\\cos 60^{\\circ}$ , therefore $x^2 - 4x - 9 = 0$ . By using the quadratic formula, $x = \\frac {4 + \\sqrt{16 + 36}}{2}$ , therefore $x = 2 + \\sqrt{13}$ . When the second longest side is $x$ , we get that $x^2 = 5^2 + 4^2 - 40\\cos 60^{\\circ}$ , therefore $x = \\sqrt{21}$ . When the second longest side is $4$ , we get that $4^2 = 5^2 + x^2 - 2(5)(x)\\cos 60^{\\circ}$ , therefore $x^2 - 5x + 9 = 0$ . Using the quadratic formula, $x = \\frac {5 + \\sqrt{25 - 36}}{2}$ .

      " If you have graph paper, use Pick's Theorem to quickly and efficiently find the area of the quadrilateral. If not, just find the area by other methods. Pick's Theorem states that $A$ = $I$  $+$  $\\frac{B}{2}$ - $1$ , where $I$ is the number of lattice points in the interior of the polygon, and $B$ is the number of lattice points on the boundary of the polygon. In this case, $A$ = $5$  $+$  $\\frac{7}{2}$ - $1$ = $7.5$  so $\\frac{A}{2}$ = $3.75$  The bottom half of the quadrilateral makes a triangle with base $4$ and half the total area, so we can deduce that the height of the triangle must be $\\frac{15}{8}$ in order for its area to be $3.75$ . This height is the y coordinate of our desired intersection point. Note that segment CD lies on the line $y = -3x + 12$ . Substituting in $\\frac{15}{8}$ for y, we can find that the x coordinate of our intersection point is $\\frac{27}{8}$ . Therefore the point of intersection is ( $\\frac{27}{8}$ , $\\frac{15}{8}$ ), and our desired result is $27+8+15+8= \\boxed{ \\text{B}) \\ 58}$ . Let the point of intersection be $E$ , with coordinates $(x, y)$ . Then, $ABCD$ is cut into $ABCE$ and $AED$ . Since the areas are equal, we can use Shoelace Theorem to find the area. This gives $3 + 3x - 3y = 4y$ . The line going through $CD$ is $y = -3x + 12$ . Since $E$ is on $CD$ , we can substitute this in, giving $3 + 3x = -21x + 84$ . Solving for $x$ gives $\\frac{27}{8}$ . Plugging this back into the line equation gives $y = \\frac{15}{8}$ , for a final answer of $\\boxed{58}$ . https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQpQaomC2tA  ~sugar_rush   2013 AMC 12A ( Problems • Answer Key • Resources )   Preceded by Problem 12   Followed by Problem 14    1  •  2  •  3  •  4  •  5  •  6  •  7  •  8  •  9  •  10  •  11  •  12  •  13  •  14  •  15  •  16  •  17  •  18  •  19  •  20  •  21  •  22  •  23  •  24  •  25    All AMC 12 Problems and Solutions    2013 AMC 10A ( Problems • Answer Key • Resources )   Preceded by Problem 17   Followed by Problem 19    1  •  2  •  3  •  4  •  5  •  6  •  7  •  8  •  9  •  10  •  11  •  12  •  13  •  14  •  15  •  16  •  17  •  18  •  19  •  20  •  21  •  22  •  23  •  24  •  25    All AMC 10 Problems and Solutions  The problems on this page are copyrighted by the Mathematical Association of America 's American Mathematics Competitions .

We break down the problem as previously shown.  Separately: All children must be split between two stores. There are $\\binom{3}{2} = 3$ ways to arrange this. We can then arrange which group is sold to which store in $4!$ ways. $4! \\cdot 3 = 72$ . Together: Both parents are in one store and the 3 children are each in another store. There are $4! = 24$ ways to arrange this. $24 + 72 = 96$ total arrangements.

      " Let pile $A$ have $A$ rocks, and so on. The total weight of $A$ and $C$ can be expressed as $44(A + C)$ . To get the total weight of $B$ and $C$ , we add the weight of $B$ and subtract the weight of $A$ : $44(A + C) + 50B - 40A = 4A + 44C + 50B$  Therefore, the mean of $B$ and $C$ is $\\frac{4A + 44C + 50B}{B + C}$ , which is simplified to $44 + \\frac{4A + 6B}{B + C}$ . We now need to eliminate $A$ in the numerator.  \n",
      "Since we know that $40A + 50B = 43(A + B)$ , we have $A = \\frac{7}{3}B$  Substituting, $44 + \\frac{4(\\frac{7}{3}B) + 6B}{B + C}=44 + \\frac{46}{3}*\\frac{B}{B + C}$  In order to maximize $\\frac{B}{B + C}$ , we can minimize the denominator by letting $C = 1$ (C must be a positive integer). Since $\\frac{46}{3}$ must cancel to give an integer, and the only fraction that satisfies both conditions is $\\frac{45}{46}$  Plugging in, we get $44 + \\frac{46}{3} * \\frac{45}{46} = 44 + 15 = 59$ , which is choice E Suppose there are $A,B,C$ rocks in the three piles, and that the mean of pile C is $x$ , and that the mean of the combination of $B$ and $C$ is $y$ . We are going to maximize $y$ , subject to the following conditions: \\[40A+50B=43(A+B)\\]  \\[40A+xC=44(A+C)\\]  \\[50B+xC=y(B+C)\\]  which can be rearranged as: \\[7B=3A\\]  \\[(x-44)C=4A\\]  \\[(x-y)C=(y-50)B\\]  Let us test $y=59$ is possible. If so, it is already the answer. If not, there will be some contradiction. So the third equation becomes \\[(x-59)C=9B.\\]  So $15C = (x-44)C - (x-59)C = 4A - 9B$ , $45C=4(3A)-27B=28B-27B$ , $105C=28A-9(7B)=A$ , therefore, $A=105C, B=45C, x=4(105)+44=464$ , which gives us a consistent solution. Therefore $y=59$ is the answer. (Note: To further illustrate the idea, let us look at $y=60$ and see what happens. We then get $7\\cdot 16C = 4A-30A<0$ , which is a contradiction!) Obtain the 3 equations as in solution 2 . \\[7B=3A\\]  \\[(x-44)C=4A\\]  \\[(x-y)C=(y-50)B\\]  Our goal is to try to isolate $y$ into an inequality. \n",
      "The first equation gives $A=\\frac{7}{3}B$ , which we plug into the second equation to get \\[(x-44)C=\\frac{28}{3}B\\]  To eliminate $x$ , subtract equation 3 from equation 2: \\[(x-44)C-(x-y)C=\\frac{28}{3}B-(y-50)B\\]  \\[(y-44)C=(\\frac{178}{3}-y)B\\]  In order for the coefficients to be positive, \\[44<y<\\frac{178}{3}\\]  Thus, the greatest integer value is $y=59$ , choice $(E)$ .

      " Solution 1 The first pirate takes $\\frac{1}{12}$ of the $x$ coins, leaving $\\frac{11}{12} x$ . The second pirate takes $\\frac{2}{12}$ of the remaining coins, leaving $\\frac{10}{12}\\cdot   \\frac{11}{12}*x$ . Note that $12^{11} = (2^2 \\cdot 3)^{11} = 2^{22} \\cdot 3^{11}$  $11! = 11 \\cdot 10 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 2$  All the $2$ s and $3$ s cancel out of $11!$ , leaving $11 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 5 = 1925$  in the numerator. We know there were just enough coins to cancel out the denominator in the fraction. So, at minimum, $x$ is the denominator, leaving $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) }1925}$ coins for the twelfth pirate. Solution 2 The answer cannot be an even number. Here is why: Consider the highest power of 2 that divides the starting number of coins, and consider how this value changes as each pirate takes their share. At each step, the size of the pile is multiplied by some $\\frac{n}{12}$ . This means the highest power of 2 that divides the number of coins is continually decreasing or staying the same (except once, briefly, when we multiply by $\\frac{2}{3}$ for pirate 4, but it immediately drops again in the next step). Therefore, if the 12th pirate's coin total were even, then it can't be the smallest possible value, because we can safely cut the initial pot (and all the intermediate totals) in half. We could continue halving the result until the 12th pirate's total is finally odd. Only one of the choices given is odd, $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) }1925}$ . Note that if there had been multiple odd answer choices, we could repeat the reasoning above to see that the value also must not be divisible by 3. Let $x$ be the number of coins the $12$ th pirate takes. Then the number of coins the $k<12$ th pirate takes is $\\frac{12}{1} \\cdot \\frac{12}{2} \\cdots \\frac{12}{12-k} x$ . For all these to be an integer, we need the denominators to divide into the numerators. Looking at prime factors, obviously there are sufficient $2$ s and $3$ s, so we just need $5^2 \\cdot 7 \\cdot 11 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(D) }1925}$ to divide into $x$ . -Frestho https://artofproblemsolving.com/videos/amc/2013amc12a/356  ~dolphin7   2013 AMC 12A ( Problems • Answer Key • Resources )   Preceded by Problem 16   Followed by Problem 18    1  •  2  •  3  •  4  •  5  •  6  •  7  •  8  •  9  •  10  •  11  •  12  •  13  •  14  •  15  •  16  •  17  •  18  •  19  •  20  •  21  •  22  •  23  •  24  •  25    All AMC 12 Problems and Solutions  The problems on this page are copyrighted by the Mathematical Association of America 's American Mathematics Competitions .

      " Set up an isosceles triangle between the center of the 8th sphere and two opposite ends of the hexagon. Then set up another triangle between the point of tangency of the 7th and 8th spheres, and the points of tangency between the 7th sphere and 2 of the original spheres on opposite sides of the hexagon. Express each side length of the triangles in terms of r (the radius of sphere 8) and h (the height of the first triangle). You can then use Pythagorean Theorem to set up two equations for the two triangles, and find the values of h and r. $(1+r)^2=2^2+h^2$  $(3\\sqrt{2})^2=3^2+(h+r)^2$  $r = \\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }\\frac{3}{2}}$  We have a regular hexagon with side lengths 2 and six spheres on each vertex with radius 1 that are internally tangent, therefore drawing radii going through all of them would create this regular hexagon. There is a larger sphere which the 6 spheres are internally tangent to, with center in the center of the hexagon. To find the radius of the larger sphere we must first, either by prior knowledge or by deducing from the angle sum that the hexagon can be split into 6 equilateral triangles from it's vertices, that the radius is $2+1=3$  The 8th sphere is now, when thinking about it in 3D, sitting on top of the 6 spheres, which is the only possibility for it to tangent all the 6 small spheres externally and the larger sphere internally. The ring of the 6 small spheres is symmetrical and the 8th sphere will be resting with it's center aligned with the diameter of the large sphere. We can therefore now create a triangle with the horizontal component 2, as it is from the vertex of the hexagon to the center of the hexagon. \n",
      "The vertical component is from the center of the large sphere to the center of the 8th sphere. This length equals 3, the radius of the large sphere, take away the radius of the 8th sphere, we can call it r, since the radius of the large sphere will include the diameter of the 8th sphere if we subtract radius we will reach the center.\n",
      "The last component is the hypotenuse of the right angled triangle. This consists of the radius of the small sphere - 1 - and the radius of the 8th sphere - r -. We therefore now have a right angled triangle which when applied Pythagoras states $2^2+(3-r)^2=(1+r)^2$ Expanding brackets gives us $4+9-6r+r^2=1+2r+r^2$ here we can cancel out $r^2$ Isolating the r's $12=8r$ and then finally we have the answer: $r=\\frac{12}{8}=\\frac{3}{2}$  2013AMC12AProblem18Solution3.png It can be seen that the diameter of the eighth sphere is equal to the radius of the seventh sphere by drawing out a diagram of the insides of the seventh sphere.

      " Imagine that the 19 numbers are just 19 persons sitting evenly around a circle $C$ ; each of them is facing to the center. One may check that $x \\succ y$ if and only if $y$ is one of the 9 persons on the left of $x$ , and $y \\succ x$ if and only if $y$ is one of the 9 persons on the right of $x$ . Therefore, \" $x \\succ y$ and $y \\succ z$ and $z \\succ x$ \" implies that $x, y, z$ cuts the circumference of $C$ into three arcs, each of which has no more than $10$ numbers sitting on it (inclusive). We count the complement: where the cut generated by $(x,y,z)$ has ONE arc that has more than $10$ persons sitting on. Note that there can only be one such arc because there are only $19$ persons in total. Suppose the number of persons on the longest arc is $k>10$ . Then two places of $x,y,z$ are just chosen from the two end-points of the arc, and there are $19-k$ possible places for the third person. Once the three places of $x,y,z$ are chosen, there are three possible ways to put $x,y,z$ into them clockwise. Also, note that for any $k>10$ , there are $19$ ways to choose an arc of length $k$ . Therefore the total number of ways (of the complement) is \\[\\sum_{k=11}^{18} 3\\cdot 19 \\cdot (19-k) = 3\\cdot 19 \\cdot (1+\\cdots+8) = 3\\cdot 19\\cdot 36\\]  So the answer is \\[3\\cdot \\binom{19}{3} - 3\\cdot 19\\cdot 36 = 3\\cdot 19 \\cdot (51 - 36) = 855\\]  NOTE: this multiple-choice problem can be done even faster -- after we realized the fact that each choice of the three places of $x,y,z$ corresponds to $3$ possible ways to put them in, and that each arc of length $k>10$ has $19$ equitable positions, it is evident that the answer should be divisible by $3\\cdot 19$ ,  which can only be $855$ from the five choices. First, we can find out that the only $x, y, z$ that satisfy the conditions in the problem are $(1 \\leq z-y \\leq 9 , 1 \\leq y-x \\leq 9 , z-x \\geq 10)$ , $(1 \\leq y-x \\leq 9 , 1 \\leq x-z \\leq 9 , y-z \\geq 10)$ , and $(1 \\leq x-z \\leq 9 , 1 \\leq z-y \\leq 9 , x-y \\geq 10)$ . Consider the 1st set of conditions for $x, y, z$ . We get that there are \\[45\\cdot 10 - \\sum_{k=1}^{9} \\binom{k+1}{2} = 285\\]  cases for the first set of conditions. Since the 2nd and 3rd set of conditions are simply rotations of the 1st set, the total number of cases is \\[3\\cdot 285 = \\fbox{(B)855}\\]   The conditions are very strange. The major way $x,y,z$ can satisfy is if $(1 \\leq z-y \\leq 9 , 1 \\leq y-x \\leq 9 , z-x \\geq 10)$ because at this point $z > x$ no matter what. This is the only case that works, but we can rotate the variables around, so our answer is a multiple of $3$ . Suppose $z=y+a$ and $y=x+b$ where $0<a,b<10$ . That means $z=x+a+b$ and $10 \\leq z \\leq 18$ . WLOG $z>y>x$ . \n",

However, at $x = 2013$ , going further than $f_{1}(x)$ will not distinguish between our answer choices. $\\log(2012 + \\log(2011))$ is nearly indistinguishable from $\\log(2012)$ . So we take $f_{1}(x)$ and plug in. $f(2013) \\approx \\log(2013 + \\log 2012)$  Since $1000 < 2012 < 10000$ , we know $3 < \\log(2012) < 4$ . This gives us our answer range: $\\log 2016 < \\log(2013 + \\log 2012) < \\log(2017)$  $(\\log 2016, \\log 2017)$  Solution 2 Suppose $A=\\log(x)$ . \n",
      "Then $\\log(2012+ \\cdots)=x-2013$ . \n",
      "So if $x>2017$ , then $\\log(2012+\\log(2011+\\cdots))>4$ . \n",
      "So $2012+\\log(2011+\\cdots)>10000$ . \n",
      "Repeating, we then get $2011+\\log(2010+\\cdots)>10^{7988}$ . \n",
      "This is clearly absurd (the RHS continues to grow more than exponentially for each iteration).\n",
      "So, $x$ is not greater than $2017$ . \n",
      "So $A<\\log(2017)$ . \n",
      "But this leaves only one answer, so we are done. Solution 3 Define $f(2) = \\log(2)$ , and $f(n) = \\log(n+f(n-1)), \\text{ for } n > 2.$ We are looking for $f(2013)$ . First we show Lemma. For any integer $n>2$ , if $n < 10^k-k$ then $f(n) < k$ . Proof. First note that $f(2) < 1$ . Let $n<10^k-k$ . Then $n+k<10^k$ , so $\\log(n+k)< k$ . Suppose the claim is true for $n-1$ . Then $f(n) = \\log(n+f(n-1)) < \\log(n + k) < k$ .  The Lemma is thus proved by induction. Finally, note that $2012 < 10^4 - 4$ so that the Lemma implies that $f(2012) < 4$ . This means that $f(2013) = \\log(2013+f(2012)) < \\log(2017)$ , which leaves us with only one option $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A) } (\\log 2016, \\log 2017)}$ . Solution 4 Define $f(2) = \\log(2)$ , and $f(n) = \\log(n+f(n-1)), \\text{ for } n > 2.$ We start with a simple observation: Lemma. For $x,y>2$ , $\\log(x+\\log(y)) < \\log(x)+\\log(y)=\\log(xy)$ . Proof. Since $x,y>2$ , we have $xy-x-y = (x-1)(y-1) - 1 > 0$ , so $xy - x-\\log(y) > xy - x - y > 0$ . It follows that $\\log(z+\\log(x+\\log(y))) < \\log(x)+\\log(y)+\\log(z)$ , and so on. Thus $f(2010) < \\log 2 + \\log 3 + \\cdots + \\log 2010 < \\log 2010 + \\cdots + \\log 2010 <  2009\\cdot 4 = 8036$ . Then $f(2011) = \\log(2011+f(2010)) < \\log(10047) < 5$ . It follows that $f(2012) = \\log(2012+f(2011)) < \\log(2017) < 4$ . Finally, we get $f(2013) = \\log(2013 + f(2012)) < \\log(2017)$ , which leaves us with only option $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A)}}$ . Solution 5 (nonrigorous + abusing answer choices.) Intuitively, you can notice that $\\log(2012+\\log(2011+\\cdots(\\log(2)\\cdots))<\\log(2013+\\log(2012+\\cdots(\\log(2))\\cdots))$ , therefore (by the answer choices) $\\log(2012+\\log(2011+\\cdots(\\log(2)\\cdots))<\\log(2021)$ . We can then say: \\[x=\\log(2013+\\log(2012+\\cdots(\\log(2))\\cdots))\\]  \\[\\log(2013)<x<\\log(2013+\\log(2021))\\]  \\[\\log(2013)<x<\\log(2013+4)\\]  \\[\\log(2013)<x<\\log(2017)\\]  The only answer choice that is possible given this information is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A)}}$  Solution 6 (super quick) Let $f(x) = \\log(x + \\log((x-1) + \\log((x-2) + \\ldots + \\log 2 \\ldots )))$ . From the answer choices, we see that $3 < f(2013) < 4$ . Since $f(x)$ grows very slowly, we can assume $3 < f(2012) < 4$ . Therefore, $f(2013) = \\log(2013 + f(2012)) \\in (\\log 2016, \\log 2017) \\implies \\boxed{\\textbf{(A)}}$ . ~rayfish Solution 7 (Not rigorous but it works) Start small from $log(3+log2)$ . Because $log2$ is close to $0$ , the expression is close to $log 3$ . This continues for the 1 digit numbers. However, when we get to $log(11+log10)$ , $log10=1$ so the expression equals $log12$ . We can round down how much each new log contributes to the expression as an approximate answer. There are 90 2 digit numbers, 900 3 digit numbers, and 1014 4 digit numbers that increase the expression. $1000< 90 \\cdot 1 + 900 \\cdot 2 + 1014 \\cdot 3< 10000$ , so it increases between 3 and 4. The answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A)}}$ . ~dragnin Solution 8 (Assumption) Consider $\\log (2013+\\log(2012))$ and disregard every other log. We do this because we assume that the logs from $2011$ onward cannot contribute more than $7987$ because of the nature of logs. We have $\\log(2016)<\\log (2013+\\log(2012))<\\log(2017)$ so the answer is $\\boxed{A}.$  Video Solution by Richard Rusczyk https://artofproblemsolving.com/videos/amc/2013amc12a/360 \n",

      " By working backwards, we can multiply 5-digit palindromes $ABCBA$ by $11$ , giving a 6-digit palindrome: $\\overline{A (A+B) (B+C) (B+C) (A+B) A}$  Note that if $A + B >= 10$ or $B + C >= 10$ , then the symmetry will be broken by carried 1s Simply count the combinations of $(A, B, C)$ for which $A + B < 10$ and $B + C < 10$  $A = 1$ implies $9$ possible $B$ (0 through 8), for each of which there are $10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2$ possible C, respectively. There are $54$ valid palindromes when $A = 1$  $A = 2$ implies $8$ possible $B$ (0 through 7), for each of which there are $10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3$ possible C, respectively.

      " We first note that diagonal $\\overline{AC}$ is of length $\\sqrt{6} + \\sqrt{2}$ . It must be that $\\overline{AP}$ divides the diagonal into two segments in the ratio $\\sqrt{3}$ to $1$ . It is not difficult to visualize that when the square is rotated, the initial and final squares overlap in a rectangular region of dimensions $2\\sqrt{3}$ by $\\sqrt{3} + 1$ . The area of the overall region (of the initial and final squares) is therefore twice the area of the original square minus the overlap, or $2 (\\sqrt{3} + 1)^2 - 2 (\\sqrt{3} + 1) = 2 (4 + 2 \\sqrt{3}) - 2 \\sqrt{3} - 2 = 6 + 2 \\sqrt{3}$ . The area also includes $4$ circular segments. Two are quarter-circles centered at $P$ of radii $\\sqrt{2}$ (the segment bounded by $\\overline{PA}$ and $\\overline{PA'}$ ) and $\\sqrt{6}$ (that bounded by $\\overline{PC}$ and $\\overline{PC'}$ ). Assuming $A$ is the bottom-left vertex and $B$ is the bottom-right one, it is clear that the third segment is formed as $B$ swings out to the right of the original square [recall that the square is rotated counterclockwise], while the fourth is formed when $D$ overshoots the final square's left edge. To find these areas, consider the perpendicular from $P$ to $\\overline{BC}$ . Call the point of intersection $E$ . From the previous paragraph, it is clear that $PE = \\sqrt{3}$ and $BE = 1$ . This means $PB = 2$ , and $B$ swings back inside edge $\\overline{BC}$ at a point $1$ unit above $E$ (since it left the edge $1$ unit below). The triangle of the circular sector is therefore an equilateral triangle of side length $2$ , and so the angle of the segment is $60^{\\circ}$ . Imagining the process in reverse, it is clear that the situation is the same with point $D$ . The area of the segments can be found by subtracting the area of the triangle from that of the sector; it follows that the two quarter-segments have areas $\\frac{1}{4} \\pi (\\sqrt{2})^2 - \\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{2} \\sqrt{2} = \\frac{\\pi}{2} - 1$ and $\\frac{1}{4} \\pi (\\sqrt{6})^2 - \\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{6} \\sqrt{6} = \\frac{3 \\pi}{2} - 3$ . The other two segments both have area $\\frac{1}{6} \\pi (2)^2 - \\frac{(2)^2 \\sqrt{3}}{4} = \\frac{2 \\pi}{3} - \\sqrt{3}$ . The total area is therefore \\[(6 + 2 \\sqrt{3}) + (\\frac{\\pi}{2} - 1) + (\\frac{3 \\pi}{2} - 3) + 2 (\\frac{2 \\pi}{3} - \\sqrt{3})\\]  \\[= 2 + 2 \\sqrt{3} + 2 \\pi + \\frac{4 \\pi}{3} - 2 \\sqrt{3}\\]  \\[= \\frac{10 \\pi}{3} + 2\\]  \\[= \\frac{1}{3} (10 \\pi + 6)\\]  Since $a = 10$ , $b = 6$ , and $c = 3$ , the answer is $a + b + c = 10 + 6 + 3 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(C)} \\ 19}$ . https://artofproblemsolving.com/videos/amc/2013amc12a/362  ~dolphin7   2013 AMC 12A ( Problems • Answer Key • Resources )   Preceded by Problem 22   Followed by Problem 24    1  •  2  •  3  •  4  •  5  •  6  •  7  •  8  •  9  •  10  •  11  •  12  •  13  •  14  •  15  •  16  •  17  •  18  •  19  •  20  •  21  •  22  •  23  •  24  •  25    All AMC 12 Problems and Solutions  The problems on this page are copyrighted by the Mathematical Association of America 's American Mathematics Competitions .

      " Suppose $p$ is the answer. We calculate $1-p$ . Assume that the circumradius of the 12-gon is $1$ , and the 6 different lengths are $a_1$ , $a_2$ , $\\cdots$ , $a_6$ , in increasing order. Then $a_k = 2\\sin ( \\frac{k\\pi}{12} )$ . So $a_1=(\\sqrt{6}-\\sqrt{2})/2 \\approx 0.5$ , $a_2=1$ , $a_3=\\sqrt{2}\\approx 1.4$ , $a_4=\\sqrt{3}\\approx 1.7$ , $a_5=(\\sqrt{6}+\\sqrt{2})/2 = a_1 + a_3$ , $a_6 = 2$ .  Now, Consider the following inequalities: $a_3>2a_1 > a_2$  $a_4> a_1 + a_2>a_3$  $a_4<a_1 + a_3=a_5$  $a_1 + a_4 > a_6$  $2a_2 = 2 = a_6$ . Thus any two segments with at least one them longer than $a_2$ have a sum greater than $a_6$ . Therefore, all triples (in increasing order) that can't be the side lengths of a triangle are the following. Note that x-y-z means $(a_x, a_y, a_z)$ : 1-1-3, 1-1-4, 1-1-5, 1-1-6,\n",

      " Suppose $f(z)=z^2+iz+1=c=a+bi$ . We look for $z$ with $\\operatorname{Im}(z)>0$ such that $a,b$ are integers where $|a|, |b|\\leq 10$ . First, use the quadratic formula: $z = \\frac{1}{2} (-i \\pm \\sqrt{-1-4(1-c)}) = -\\frac{i}{2} \\pm \\sqrt{ -\\frac{5}{4} + c }$  Generally, consider the imaginary part of a radical of a complex number: $\\sqrt{u}$ , where $u = v+wi = r e^{i\\theta}$ . $\\operatorname{Im}(\\sqrt{u}) = \\operatorname{Im}(\\pm \\sqrt{r} e^{i\\theta/2}) = \\pm \\sqrt{r} \\sin(\\theta/2) = \\pm \\sqrt{r}\\sqrt{\\frac{1-\\cos\\theta}{2}} = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{r-v}{2}}$ . Now let $u= -5/4 + c$ , then $v = -5/4 + a$ , $w=b$ , $r=\\sqrt{v^2 + w^2}$ . Note that $\\operatorname{Im}(z)>0$ if and only if $\\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{r-v}{2}}>\\frac{1}{2}$ . The latter is true only when we take the positive sign, and that $r-v > 1/2$ , or $v^2 + w^2 > (1/2 + v)^2 = 1/4 + v + v^2$ , $w^2 > 1/4 + v$ , or $b^2 > a-1$ . In other words, when $b^2 > a-1$ , the equation $f(z)=a+bi$ has unique solution $z$ in the region $\\operatorname{Im}(z)>0$ ; and when $b^2 \\leq a-1$ there is no solution. Therefore the number of desired solution $z$ is the same as the number of ordered pairs $(a,b)$ such that integers $|a|, |b|\\leq 10$ , and that $b^2 \\geq a$ . When $a\\leq 0$ , there is no restriction on $b$ so there are $11\\cdot 21 = 231$ pairs; when $a > 0$ , there are $2(1+4+9+10+10+10+10+10+10+10)=2(84)=168$ pairs. So there are $231+168=\\boxed{399}$ in total. We consider the function $f(z)$ as a mapping from the 2-D complex plane onto itself. We complete the square of $f(z)=z^2+iz+1=(z+\\frac{i}{2})^2+\\frac{5}{4}$ . Now, we must decide the range of $f(z)$ based on the domain of $z$ , $\\operatorname{Im}(z)>0$ . To do this, we are interested in mapping the boundary line $\\operatorname{Im}(z)=0$ . To make the mapping simpler, let $f(z)=g(z)+\\frac{5}{4}$ , or $g(z)=(z+\\frac{i}{2})^2$ . We intend to map of the line $\\operatorname{Im}(z)=0$ using the function $g(z)$ . This transformation is equivalent to the polar equation $r=(\\frac{1}{2}\\csc(\\frac{\\theta}{2}))^2$ . Using polar and trig identities, we can restate this equation as the rectangular form of a parabola, $x=y^2-\\frac{1}{4}$ , where $x=\\operatorname{Re}(z)$ and $y=\\operatorname{Im}(z)$ . So, we conclude that $f(z)$ maps the line $\\operatorname{Im}(z)=0$ to the parabola $x=y^2-\\frac{1}{4}+\\frac{5}{4}=y^2+1$ . A quick check reveals that the range of $f(z)$ is to the left of the parabola, meaning that any point on or to the right of parabola cannot be reached. Since the problem requires $|\\operatorname{Re}(z)|$ and $|\\operatorname{Im}(z)|$ to both be integers and at most 10, all that remains is counting all points with integer coordinates in the range of $f(z), \\operatorname{Im}(z)>0$ . To do this, we employ complementary counting. The points of interest are $|\\operatorname{Re}(z)|\\leq 10$ and $|\\operatorname{Im}(z)|\\leq 10$ , resulting in a total of $441$ points. For lattice points on or to the right of the parabola, there are $10$ points for $x=0$ , $9$ points for $x=\\pm 1$ , $6$ points for $x=\\pm 2$ , and $1$ point for $x=\\pm 3$ . Summing it all together, our answer is $441-(10+2*9+2*6+2*1)=\\boxed{399}$ . https://artofproblemsolving.com/videos/amc/2013amc12a/365    2013 AMC 12A ( Problems • Answer Key • Resources )   Preceded by Problem 24   Followed by Last Question    1  •  2  •  3  •  4  •  5  •  6  •  7  •  8  •  9  •  10  •  11  •  12  •  13  •  14  •  15  •  16  •  17  •  18  •  19  •  20  •  21  •  22  •  23  •  24  •  25    All AMC 12 Problems and Solutions  The problems on this page are copyrighted by the Mathematical Association of America 's American Mathematics Competitions .

We call $\\overline{BC}$ the base and the altitude from $A$ to the line connecting $B$ and $C$ , $y=-1$ , the height. The altitude has length $|-2-1|=3$ , and the area of $\\triangle{ABC}=3$ . Since $A={bh}/2$ , $b=2$ . Because $l_3$ has positive slope, it will meet $l_2$ to the right of $B$ , and the point $2$ to the right of $B$ is $(3,1)$ . $l_3$ passes through $(-1,-2)$ and $(3,1)$ , and thus has slope $\\frac{|1-(-2)|}{|3-(-1)|}=$  $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }\\frac{3}{4}}$ .

      " If Alex goes to the red booth 3 times, then goes to the blue booth once, Alex can exchange 6 red tokens for 4 silver tokens and one red token. Similarly, if Alex goes to the blue booth 2 times, then goes to the red booth once, Alex can exchange 6 blue tokens for 3 silver tokens and one blue token. Let's call the first combination Combo 1, and the second combination Combo 2. In other words, Alex can exchange 5 red tokens for 4 silver tokens as long as he has at least 6 red tokens, and Alex can exchange 5 blue tokens for 3 silver tokens as long as he has at least 6 blue tokens. Hence after performing 14 Combo 1's and 14 Combo 2's, we end up with 5 red, 5 blue, and 98 silver tokens. Finally, Alex can visit the blue booth once, then do Combo 1, then visit the blue booth once more to end up with 1 red token, 2 blue tokens, and $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E)}\\ 103}$ silver tokens, at which point it is clear he cannot use the booths anymore. We can approach this problem by assuming he goes to the red booth first. You start with $75 \\text{R}$ and $75 \\text{B}$ and at the end of the first booth, you will have $1 \\text{R}$ and $112 \\text{B}$ and $37 \\text{S}$ . We now move to the blue booth, and working through each booth until we have none left, we will end up with: $1 \\text{R}$ , $2 \\text{B}$ and $103 \\text{S}$ . So, the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E)}103}$  Let $x$ denote the number of visits to the first booth and $y$ denote the number of visits to the second booth. Then we can describe the quantities of his red and blue coins as follows: \\[R(x,y)=-2x+y+75\\]  \\[B(x,y)=x-3y+75\\] There are no legal exchanges when he has fewer than $2$ red coins and fewer than $3$ blue coins, namely when he has a red coin and $2$ blue coins. We can then create a system of equations: \\[1=-2x+y+75\\]  \\[2=x-3y+75\\] Solving yields $x=59$ and $y=44$ . Since he gains one silver coin per visit to each booth, he has $x+y=44+59=\\boxed{\\textbf{(E)}103}$ silver coins in total. Suppose we set the values of the coins: Red = 4, Blue = 3, Silver = 5. This way, whenever an exchange is made, Alex's total value in coins does not change. His total value at the beginning (and thus also at the end) is $3\\cdot 75+4\\cdot 75=525$ , so his theoretical possible total (if everything works out perfectly) is 105. Note that the maximum possible leftover red coins is 1, and the maximum possible leftover blue coins is 2, so the maximum leftover non-silver value is 10. This perfectly gives us 103 silver coins.   2013 AMC 10B ( Problems • Answer Key • Resources )   Preceded by Problem 16   Followed by Problem 18    1  •  2  •  3  •  4  •  5  •  6  •  7  •  8  •  9  •  10  •  11  •  12  •  13  •  14  •  15  •  16  •  17  •  18  •  19  •  20  •  21  •  22  •  23  •  24  •  25    All AMC 10 Problems and Solutions    2013 AMC 12B ( Problems • Answer Key • Resources )   Preceded by Problem 9   Followed by Problem 11    1  •  2  •  3  •  4  •  5  •  6  •  7  •  8  •  9  •  10  •  11  •  12  •  13  •  14  •  15  •  16  •  17  •  18  •  19  •  20  •  21  •  22  •  23  •  24  •  25    All AMC 12 Problems and Solutions  The problems on this page are copyrighted by the Mathematical Association of America 's American Mathematics Competitions .

      " Since the angles of Quadrilateral $ABCD$ form an arithmetic sequence, we can assign each angle with the value $a$ , $a+d$ , $a+2d$ , and $a+3d$ . Also, since these angles form an arithmetic progression, we can reason out that $(a)+(a+3d)=(a+d)+(a+2d)=180$ . For the sake of simplicity, lets rename the angles of each similar triangle. Let $\\angle ADB = \\angle CBD = \\alpha$ , $\\angle DBA = \\angle DCB = \\beta$ , $\\angle CDB = \\angle BAD = \\gamma$ . Now the four angles of $ABCD$ are $\\beta$ , $\\alpha + \\beta$ , $\\gamma$ , and $\\alpha + \\gamma$ . As for the similar triangles, we can name their angles $y$ , $y+b$ , and $y+2b$ . Therefore $y+y+b+y+2b=180$ and $y+b=60$ . Because these 3 angles are each equal to one of $\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma$ , we know that one of these three angles is equal to 60 degrees. Now we we use trial and error. Let $\\alpha = 60^{\\circ}$ . Then the angles of ABCD are $\\beta$ , $60^{\\circ} + \\beta$ , $\\gamma$ , and $60^{\\circ} + \\gamma$ . Since these four angles add up to 360, then $\\beta + \\gamma= 120$ . If we list them in increasing value, we get $\\beta$ , $\\gamma$ , $60^{\\circ} + \\beta$ , $60^{\\circ} + \\gamma$ . Note that this is the only sequence that works because the common difference is less than 45. So, this would give us the four angles 45, 75, 105, and 135. In this case, $\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma$ also form an arithmetic sequence with 45, 60, and 75, and the largest two angles of the quadrilateral add up to 240 which is an answer choice. If we apply the same reasoning to $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$ , we would get the sum of the highest two angles as 220, which works but is lower than 240. Therefore, $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) }240}$ is the correct answer.   2013 AMC 12B ( Problems • Answer Key • Resources )   Preceded by Problem 12   Followed by Problem 14    1  •  2  •  3  •  4  •  5  •  6  •  7  •  8  •  9  •  10  •  11  •  12  •  13  •  14  •  15  •  16  •  17  •  18  •  19  •  20  •  21  •  22  •  23  •  24  •  25    All AMC 12 Problems and Solutions  The problems on this page are copyrighted by the Mathematical Association of America 's American Mathematics Competitions .

To minimize $c$ and $d$ , we have $(c,d)=(8,5)$ , or \\[5a_1+8a_2=5(a_1+8)+8(a_2-5).\\] To minimize $a_1$ and $b_1$ , we have $(a_1,b_1)=(0,0+c)=(0,8)$ .

      " The prime factorization of $2013$ is $61\\cdot11\\cdot3$ . To have a factor of $61$ in the numerator and to minimize $a_1,$  $a_1$ must equal $61$ . Now we notice that there can be no prime $p$ which is not a factor of $2013$ such that $b_1<p<61,$ because this prime will not be canceled out in the denominator, and will lead to an extra factor in the numerator. The highest prime less than $61$ is $59$ , so there must be a factor of $59$ in the denominator. It follows that $b_1 = 59$ (to minimize $b_1$ as well), so the answer is $|61-59| = \\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }2}$ . One possible way to express $2013$ with $(a_1, b_1) = (61, 59)$ is \\[2013 = \\frac{61!\\cdot19!\\cdot11!}{59!\\cdot20!\\cdot10!}.\\]  https://youtube.com/FvscTObzpwA  ~IceMatrix https://youtu.be/GdfR_UjhYYQ  ~savannahsolver   2013 AMC 10B ( Problems • Answer Key • Resources )   Preceded by Problem 19   Followed by Problem 21    1  •  2  •  3  •  4  •  5  •  6  •  7  •  8  •  9  •  10  •  11  •  12  •  13  •  14  •  15  •  16  •  17  •  18  •  19  •  20  •  21  •  22  •  23  •  24  •  25    All AMC 10 Problems and Solutions    2013 AMC 12B ( Problems • Answer Key • Resources )   Preceded by Problem 14   Followed by Problem 16    1  •  2  •  3  •  4  •  5  •  6  •  7  •  8  •  9  •  10  •  11  •  12  •  13  •  14  •  15  •  16  •  17  •  18  •  19  •  20  •  21  •  22  •  23  •  24  •  25    All AMC 12 Problems and Solutions  The problems on this page are copyrighted by the Mathematical Association of America 's American Mathematics Competitions .

      " The five pointed star can be thought of as five triangles sitting on the five sides of the pentagon. Because the pentagon is equiangular, each of its angles has measure $\\frac{180^\\circ (5-2)}{5}=108^\\circ$ , and so the base angles of the aforementioned triangles (i.e., the angles adjacent to the pentagon) have measure $180^\\circ - 108^\\circ = 72^\\circ$ . The base angles are equal, so the triangles must be isosceles. Let one of the sides of the pentagon have length $x_1$ (and the others $x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5$ ). Then, by trigonometry, the non-base sides of the triangle sitting on that side of the pentagon each has length $\\frac{x_1}{2} \\sec 72^\\circ$ , and so the two sides together have length $x_1 \\sec 72^\\circ$ . To find the perimeter of the star, we sum up the lengths of the non-base sides for each of the five triangles to get $(x_1+x_2+x_3+x_4+x_5) \\sec 72^\\circ = (1) \\sec 72^\\circ = \\sec 72^\\circ$ (because the perimeter of the pentagon is $1$ ). The perimeter of the star is constant, so the difference between the maximum and minimum perimeters is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A)} \\ 0}$ . The extreme case, that results in the minimum and/or maximum, would probably be a pentagon that approaches a degenerate pentagon. However, due to the way the problem is phrased, we know there exists a minimum and maximum; therefore, we can reasonably assume that the star's perimeter is constant, and answer with $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A)} \\ 0}$ .   2013 AMC 12B ( Problems • Answer Key • Resources )   Preceded by Problem 15   Followed by Problem 17    1  •  2  •  3  •  4  •  5  •  6  •  7  •  8  •  9  •  10  •  11  •  12  •  13  •  14  •  15  •  16  •  17  •  18  •  19  •  20  •  21  •  22  •  23  •  24  •  25    All AMC 12 Problems and Solutions  The problems on this page are copyrighted by the Mathematical Association of America 's American Mathematics Competitions .

      " Since $\\angle{AFB}=\\angle{ADB}=90^{\\circ}$ , quadrilateral $ABDF$ is cyclic. It follows that $\\angle{ADE}=\\angle{ABF}$ , so $\\triangle ABF \\sim \\triangle ADE$ are similar. In addition, $\\triangle ADE \\sim \\triangle ACD$ . We can easily find $AD=12$ , $BD = 5$ , and $DC=9$ using Pythagorean triples. So, the ratio of the longer leg to the hypotenuse of all three similar triangles is $\\tfrac{12}{15} = \\tfrac{4}{5}$ , and the ratio of the shorter leg to the hypotenuse is $\\tfrac{9}{15} = \\tfrac{3}{5}$ . It follows that $AF=(\\tfrac{4}{5}\\cdot 13), BF=(\\tfrac{3}{5}\\cdot 13)$ . Let $x=DF$ . By Ptolemy's Theorem , we have \\[13x+\\left(5\\cdot 13\\cdot \\frac{4}{5}\\right)= 12\\cdot 13\\cdot \\frac{3}{5} \\qquad \\Leftrightarrow \\qquad 13x+52=93.6.\\] Dividing by $13$ we get $x+4=7.2\\implies x=\\frac{16}{5}$ so our answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }21}$ . ~Edits by BakedPotato66 From solution 1, we know that $AD = 12$ and $DC = 9$ . Since $\\triangle ADC \\sim \\triangle DEC$ , we can figure out that $DE = \\frac{36}{5}$ . We also know what $AC$ is so we can figure what $AE$ is: $AE = 15 - \\frac{27}{5} = \\frac{48}{5}$ . Quadrilateral $ABDF$ is cyclic, implying that $\\angle{B} + \\angle{DFA}$ = 180°. Therefore, $\\angle{B} = 180 - \\angle{DFA} = \\angle{EFA}$ , and triangles $\\triangle AEF \\sim \\triangle ADB$ . Solving the resulting proportion gives $EF = 4$ . Therefore, $DF = ED - EF = \\frac{16}{5}$ . $m + n = 16 + 5 = 21$ and our answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) } 21}$ . $\\triangle ADC \\sim \\triangle DEC$ because of $AA \\sim$ . $\\angle{ADC} = \\angle{DEC} = 90°$ . Lets say $\\angle{ADE} = x$ . So $\\angle{EDC} = 90 - x$ and $\\angle{DEC} = 180 - 90 - (90 - x) = x$ so $\\angle{ADE} = \\angle{DEC}$  ~ South  If we draw a diagram as given, but then add point $G$ on $\\overline{BC}$ such that $\\overline{FG}\\perp\\overline{BC}$ in order to use the Pythagorean theorem, we end up with similar triangles $\\triangle{DFG}$ and $\\triangle{DCE}$ . Thus, $FG=\\tfrac35x$ and $DG=\\tfrac45x$ , where $x$ is the length of $\\overline{DF}$ . Using the Pythagorean theorem, we now get \\[BF = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac45x+ 5\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac35x\\right)^2}\\] and $AF$ can be found out noting that $AE$ is just $\\tfrac{48}5$ through base times height (since $12\\cdot 9 = 15 \\cdot \\tfrac{36}5$ , similar triangles gives $AE = \\tfrac{48}5$ ), and that $EF$ is just $\\tfrac{36}5 - x$ .  From there, \\[AF = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{36}5 - x\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{48}5\\right)^2}.\\] Now, $BF^2 + AF^2 = 169$ , and squaring and adding both sides and subtracting a 169 from both sides gives $2x^2 - \\tfrac{32}5x = 0$ , so $x = \\tfrac{16}5$ . Thus, the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B)}}$ . First, we find $BD = 5$ , $DC = 9$ , and $AD = 12$ via the Pythagorean Theorem or by using similar triangles. Next, because $DE$ is an altitude of triangle $ADC$ , $DE = \\frac{AD\\cdot DC}{AC} = \\frac{36}{5}$ . Using that, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem and similar triangles to find $EC = \\frac{27}{5}$ and $AE = \\frac{48}{5}$ . Points $A$ , $B$ , $D$ , and $F$ all lie on a circle whose diameter is $AB$ . Let the point where the circle intersects $AC$ be $G$ . Using power of a point, we can write the following equation to solve for $AG$ : \\[DC\\cdot BC = CG\\cdot AC\\]  \\[9\\cdot 14 = CG\\cdot 15\\]  \\[CG = 126/15\\] Using that, we can find $AG = \\frac{99}{15}$ , and using $AG$ , we can find that $GE = 3$ . We can use power of a point again to solve for $DF$ : \\[FE\\cdot DE = GE\\cdot AE\\]  \\[(\\frac{36}{5} - DF)\\cdot \\frac{36}{5} = 3 \\cdot \\frac{48}{5}\\]  \\[\\frac{36}{5} - DF = 4\\]  \\[DF = \\frac{16}{5} = \\frac{m}{n}\\] Thus, $m+n = 16+5 = 21$  $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B)}}$ . https://youtu.be/XZBKnobK-JU?t=3064    2013 AMC 12B ( Problems • Answer Key • Resources )   Preceded by Problem 18   Followed by Problem 20    1  •  2  •  3  •  4  •  5  •  6  •  7  •  8  •  9  •  10  •  11  •  12  •  13  •  14  •  15  •  16  •  17  •  18  •  19  •  20  •  21  •  22  •  23  •  24  •  25    All AMC 12 Problems and Solutions    2013 AMC 10B ( Problems • Answer Key • Resources )   Preceded by Problem 22   Followed by Problem 24    1  •  2  •  3  •  4  •  5  •  6  •  7  •  8  •  9  •  10  •  11  •  12  •  13  •  14  •  15  •  16  •  17  •  18  •  19  •  20  •  21  •  22  •  23  •  24  •  25    All AMC 10 Problems and Solutions  The problems on this page are copyrighted by the Mathematical Association of America 's American Mathematics Competitions .

      " Being on two parabolas means having the same distance from the common focus and both directrices. In particular, you have to be on an angle bisector of the directrices, and clearly on the same \"side\" of the directrices as the focus. So it's easy to see there are at most two solutions per pair of parabolae. Convexity and continuity imply exactly two solutions unless the directrices are parallel and on the same side of the focus. So out of $2\\dbinom{30}{2}$ possible intersection points, only $2*5*2*\\dbinom{3}{2}$ fail to exist. This leaves $870-60=810=\\boxed{\\textbf{(C)} \\ 810}$ solutions. Through similar reasoning as above in Solution I, determine that two parabolas that have a common focus intersect zero times if there directrixes are parallel and the focus lies on the same side of both directrixes, and intersect twice otherwise. Thereby, as each parabola will intersect $30-3 = 27$ other parabolas twice, we see that the answer is \\[2 \\times \\frac{30 \\times 27}{2} = \\boxed{810}.\\]    2013 AMC 12B ( Problems • Answer Key • Resources )   Preceded by Problem 20   Followed by Problem 22    1  •  2  •  3  •  4  •  5  •  6  •  7  •  8  •  9  •  10  •  11  •  12  •  13  •  14  •  15  •  16  •  17  •  18  •  19  •  20  •  21  •  22  •  23  •  24  •  25    All AMC 12 Problems and Solutions  The problems on this page are copyrighted by the Mathematical Association of America 's American Mathematics Competitions .

      " First, we can examine the units digits of the number base 5 and base 6 and eliminate some possibilities. Say that $N \\equiv a \\pmod{6}$  also that $N \\equiv b \\pmod{5}$  Substituting these equations into the question and setting the units digits of $2N$ and $S$ equal to each other, it can be seen that $b < 5$ (because otherwise $a$ and $b$ will have different parities), and thus $a=b$ . $N \\equiv a \\pmod{6}$ , $N \\equiv  a \\pmod{5}$ , $\\implies N=a \\pmod{30}$ , $0 \\le a \\le 4$  Therefore, $N$ can be written as $30x+y$ and $2N$ can be written as $60x+2y$  Just keep in mind that $y$ can be one of five choices: $0, 1, 2, 3,$ or $4$ , ;\n",

Thus, \\[50a_1+50a_2+50a_3+10a_4 \\equiv 10a_4+10b_3\\pmod{100}\\] canceling out $10a_4$ , we have \\[50a_1+50a_2+50a_3 \\equiv 10b_3\\pmod{100}\\]  \\[5a_1+5a_2+5a_3 \\equiv b_3\\pmod{10}\\]  \\[5(a_1+a_2+a_3) \\equiv b_3\\pmod{10}\\]  Thus $b_3$ is a multiple of $5$ . Now going back to our original equation \\[625a_1+125a_2+25a_3+5a_4+a_5=216b_1+36b_2+6b_3+b_4\\] Since $a_5=b_4$ , \\[625a_1+125a_2+25a_3+5a_4=216b_1+36b_2+6b_3\\]  \\[5(125a_1+25a_2+5a_3+a_4)=6(36b_1+6b_2+b_3)\\]  \\[5(125a_1+25a_2+5a_3+a_4)=6[6(6b_1+b_2)+b_3]\\]  Since the left side is a multiple of $5$ , then so does the right side. Thus $5\\mid6(6b_1+b_2)+b_3$ . Since we already know that $5\\mid b_3$ , then $5\\mid6(6b_1+b_2)$ , from where we also know that $5\\mid6b_1+b_2$ . For $b_1,b_2<6$ , there is a total of 7 ordered pairs that satisfy the condition. Namely, \\[(b_1,b_2)=(0,0),(0,5),(1,4),(2,3),(3,2),(4,1),(5,0)\\]  Since $N_6$ has at least $3$ digits, $(b_1,b_2)=(0,0)$ doesn't work. Furthermore, when $b_1=5$ , $216b_1$ exceeds $1000$ which is not possible as $N$ is a three digit number, thus $(b_1,b_2)=(5,0)$ won't work as well. Since we know that $a_i<5$ , for each of the ordered pairs $(b_1,b_2)$ , there is respectively one and only one solution $(a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4)$ that satisfies the equation \\[625a_1+125a_2+25a_3+5a_4=216b_1+36b_2+6b_3\\]  Thus there are five solutions to the equation. Also since we have 5 possibilities for $a_5=b_4$ , we have a total of $5\\cdot5=25$ values for $N$ . $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) }25}$  ~ Nafer Observe that the maximum possible value of the sum of the last two digits of the base $5$ number and the base $6$ number is $44+55=99$ . \n",

      " Let $BN=x$ and $NA=y$ . From the conditions, let's deduct some convenient conditions that seem sufficient to solve the problem.  $M$ is the midpoint of side $AC$ .  This implies that $[ABX]=[CBX]$ . Given that angle $ABX$ is $60$ degrees and angle $BXC$ is $120$ degrees, we can use the area formula to get \\[\\frac{1}{2}(x+y)x \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} x \\cdot CX \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\]  So, $x+y=CX$ .....(1)  $CN$ is angle bisector.  In the triangle $ABC$ , one has $BC/AC=x/y$ , therefore $BC=2x/y$ .....(2) Furthermore, triangle $BCN$ is similar to triangle $MCX$ , so $BC/CM=CN/CX$ , therefore $BC = (CX+x)/CX = (2x+y)/(x+y)$ ....(3) By (2) and (3) and the subtraction law of ratios, we get \\[BC=2x/y = (2x+y)/(y+x) = y/x\\]  Therefore $2x^2=y^2$ , or $y=\\sqrt{2}x$ . So $BC = 2x/(\\sqrt{2}x) = \\sqrt{2}$ . Finally, using the law of cosine for triangle $BCN$ , we get \\[2 = BC^2 = x^2 + (2x+y)^2 - x(2x+y) = 3x^2 + 3xy + y^2 = \\left(5+3\\sqrt{2}\\right)x^2\\]  \\[x^2 = \\frac{2}{5+3\\sqrt{2}} = \\boxed{\\textbf{(A) }\\frac{10-6\\sqrt{2}}{7}}.\\]  2013 AMC 12B 24.jpg Let us dilate triangle $ABC$ so that the sides of equilateral triangle $BXN$ are all equal to $2.$ The purpose of this is to ease the calculations we make in the problem. Given this, we aim to find the length of segment $AM$ so that we can un-dilate triangle $ABC$ by dividing each of its sides by $AM$ . Doing so will make it so that $AM = 1$ , as desired, and doing so will allow us to get the length of $BN$ , whose square is our final answer. Let $O$ the foot of the altitude from $B$ to $NX.$ On the coordinate plane, position $O$ at $(0, 0)$ , and make $NX$ lie on the x-axis. Since points $N$ , $X$ , and $C$ , are collinear, $C$ must also lie on the x-axis. Additionally, since $NX = 2$ , $OB = \\sqrt{3}$ , meaning that we can position point $B$ at $(0, \\sqrt{3})$ . Now, notice that line $\\overline{AB}$ has the equation $y = \\sqrt{3}x + \\sqrt{3}$ and that line $\\overline{BM}$ has the equation $y = -\\sqrt{3}x + \\sqrt{3}$ because angles $BNX$ and $BXN$ are both $60^{\\circ}$ . We can then position $A$ at point $(n, \\sqrt{3}(n + 1))$ and $C$ at point $(p, 0)$ . Quickly note that, because $CN$ is an angle bisector, $AC$ must pass through the point $(0, -\\sqrt{3})$ . We proceed to construct a system of equations. First observe that the midpoint $M$ of $AC$ must lie on $BM$ , with the equation $y = -\\sqrt{3}x + \\sqrt{3}$ . The coordinates of $M$ are $\\left(\\frac{p + n}{2}, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}(n + 1)\\right)$ , and we can plug in these coordinates into the equation of line $BM$ , yielding that \\[\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}(n + 1) = -\\sqrt{3}(\\frac{p + n}{2}) + \\sqrt{3} \\implies n + 1 = -p - n + 2 \\implies p = -2n + 1.\\] For our second equation, notice that line $AC$ has equation $y = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{p}x - \\sqrt{3}$ . Midpoint $M$ must also lie on this line, and we can substitute coordinates again to get \\[\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}(n + 1) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{p}(\\frac{p + n}{2}) - \\sqrt{3} \\implies n + 1 = \\frac{p + n}{p} - 2 \\implies n + 1 = \\frac{n}{p} - 1\\]  \\[\\implies p = \\frac{n}{n + 2}.\\]  Setting both equations equal to each other and multiplying both sides by $(n + 2)$ , we have that $-2n^2 - 4n + n + 2 = n \\implies -2n^2 - 4n + 2 = 0$ , which in turn simplifies into $0 = n^2 + 2n - 1$ when dividing the entire equation by $-2.$ Using the quadratic formula, we have that \\[n = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} = -1 - \\sqrt{2}.\\] Here, we discard the positive root since $A$ must lie to the left of the y-axis. Then, the coordinates of $C$ are $(3 + 2\\sqrt{2}, 0)$ , and the coordinates of $A$ are $(-1 - \\sqrt{2}, -\\sqrt{6}).$ Seeing that segment $AM$ has half the length of side $AC$ , we have that the length of $AM$ is \\[\\frac{\\sqrt{(3 + 2\\sqrt{2} - (-1 - \\sqrt{2}))^2 + (\\sqrt{6})^2}}{2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{16 + 24\\sqrt{2} + 18 + 6}}{2} = \\sqrt{10 + 6\\sqrt{2}}.\\]  Now, we divide each side length of $\\triangle ABC$ by $AM$ , and from this, $BN^2$ will equal $\\left(\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{10 + 6\\sqrt{2}}}\\right)^2 = \\frac{2}{5+3\\sqrt{2}} = \\boxed{\\textbf{(A) }\\frac{10-6\\sqrt{2}}{7}.}$  By some angle-chasing, we find that $\\triangle ANC \\sim \\triangle BXC$ . From here, construct a point $D$ on $AC$ such that $\\triangle DXC \\sim \\triangle ANC$ . Now, let $BC = a$ , which means that $DM = a - 1$ and $AD = 2 - a$ , and let $BN = BX = XN = XD = DN = b$ . Note that we want to compute $b^2$ . Because $\\triangle AND \\sim \\triangle DXM$ , we have: \\[\\frac{AN}{2-a} = \\frac{b}{a-1} \\implies AN = \\frac{b(2-a)}{(a-1)}\\]  However, we have more similar triangles. In fact, going back to our original pair of similar triangles - $\\triangle ANC$ and $\\triangle BXC$ - gives us more similarity ratios: \\[\\frac{AN}{AC} = \\frac{BX}{BC} \\implies \\frac{\\frac{b(2-a)}{(a-1)}}{2} = \\frac{b}{a} \\implies a = \\sqrt{2}\\]  Since we constructed point $D$ such that $DX$ is parallel to $AB$ , we now examine trapezoid $ABXD$ . From the variables that we already set up, we know that $AB = b + b\\sqrt{2}, BX = XD = b$ , and $DA = 2 - \\sqrt{2}$ . Let $X'$ denote the foot of the perpendicular from $X$ to base $AB$ and define $D'$ similarly. Because $\\triangle BXX'$ is a $30, 60, 90$ triangle, $XX' = \\frac{b\\sqrt{3}}{2}$ and $BX' = \\frac{b}{2}$ . Thus, $D'A = b\\sqrt{2} - \\frac{b}{2}$ and $DD' = XX' = \\frac{b\\sqrt{3}}{2}$ . By the Pythagorean Theorem on $\\triangle ADD'$ , \\[\\left (b\\sqrt{2} - \\frac{b}{2} \\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{b\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\right)^2 = \\left(2 - \\sqrt{2} \\right)^2 \\implies b^2 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(A) } \\frac{10-6\\sqrt{2}}{7}}\\] .  Since $\\triangle BXN$ is equilateral, let's assume the sides of them are all $a$ , and denote the length of $XM$ is $m$ . Since $CN$ bisects $\\angle BCA$ , applying the angle bisector theorem and we can get $BC=\\frac{a}{m}$ ; $AN=2m$ . Now applying LOC, we can get $(a+2m)^2+(a+m)^2-2(a+2m)(a+m)\\cos\\frac{\\pi}{3}=1$ . We get $a^2+3m^2+3am=1$ . Now applying the Stewart theorem in $\\triangle BAC$ , we can find that ${\\frac{a^2}{m^2}+(a+2m)^2=2(1+(a+m)^2)}$ , after simplifying, we get ${\\frac{a^2}{m^2}-a^2+2m^2=2}$ . After observation, the main key for this problem is $a^2$ , so we can solve $a$ in term of $m$ . Let's see the equation ${\\frac{a^2}{m^2}-a^2+2m^2=2}$ , we can find that $a=\\sqrt{2}m$ so $a^2=2m^2$ . Now back solving the first equation we can get that $a=\\frac{-3m+\\sqrt{4-3m^2}}{m}$ cuz the negative one can't work. After solving, we can get that $m^2=\\frac{1}{5+3\\sqrt{2}}$ so $a^2=2m^2$ and we get $a^2 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(A) } \\frac{10-6\\sqrt{2}}{7}}$ ~ bluesoul Denote the length of $AN$ as $a$ and the length of $NB$ as $b.$  Let $M'$ be the midpoint of $\\overline{BC} .$ Denote the intersection of $\\overline{MM'}$ and $\\overline{CN}$ as $X' .$ Note that $MX' = \\frac12 AN = \\frac{a}{2}$ and $CN = 2\\cdot NX' .$ As $\\overline{MM'} || \\overline{AB},$ we have that $\\triangle MXX' \\sim \\triangle BXN$ or $\\triangle MXX'$ is equilateral and $XX' =MX' = \\frac{a}{2}.$ Thus, $CN = 2b+a$ and $CX=a+b.$  Observe that \\[\\triangle BXC\\sim \\triangle ANC \\implies \\frac{BX}{XC} =\\frac{AN}{NC} \\implies \\frac{b}{b+a} = \\frac{a}{2b+a} \\implies a = \\sqrt 2 b.\\]  By the angle bisector theorem, we have that $BC=\\frac{2b}{a} = \\sqrt 2.$  We apply the Law of Cosines on $\\triangle BXC$ as follows: \\[BC^2=BX^2+XC^2-2BX\\cdot XC\\cdot \\cos120^\\circ\\]  \\begin{align*} 2&=b^2+(\\sqrt 2+1)^2b^2 +(\\sqrt2 + 1)b^2 \\\\ &=b^2(5+3\\sqrt 2) \\end{align*} or \\[\\boxed{b^2=\\textbf{(A) } \\frac{10-6\\sqrt{2}}{7}}\\]  ~ASAB 2013AMC12BProblem24Solution6.png $\\angle BXC = \\angle ANC$ , $\\angle BCX = \\angle ACN$ , $\\triangle BCX \\sim \\triangle ACN$ , $\\frac{CX}{CN} = \\frac{BC}{AC}$  $\\angle MBC = \\angle BAC$ , $\\angle BCM = \\angle ACB$ , $\\triangle BCM \\sim \\triangle ACB$ , $\\frac{BC}{AC} = \\frac{CM}{BC}$ , $BC = \\sqrt{2}$  Let $BX = x$ , $CN = CX + x$ , $\\frac{CX}{CX + x} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$ , $2CX = CX \\sqrt{2} + x \\sqrt{2}$ , $CX = x(\\sqrt{2} + 1)$  $BC^2 = BX^2 + CX^2 - 2 \\cdot BX \\cdot CX \\cdot \\cos 120^\\circ$  $2 = x^2(\\sqrt{2} + 1)^2 + x^2 + x^2(\\sqrt{2} + 1) = 5x^2 + 3x^2 \\sqrt{2}$  $x^2 = \\frac{2}{5 + 3 \\sqrt{2} } = \\boxed{\\textbf{(A) }\\frac{10-6\\sqrt{2}}{7}}$  ~ isabelchen  https://youtu.be/y0s6OTQ7KfI  ~r00tsOfUnity   2013 AMC 12B ( Problems • Answer Key • Resources )   Preceded by Problem 23   Followed by Problem 25    1  •  2  •  3  •  4  •  5  •  6  •  7  •  8  •  9  •  10  •  11  •  12  •  13  •  14  •  15  •  16  •  17  •  18  •  19  •  20  •  21  •  22  •  23  •  24  •  25    All AMC 12 Problems and Solutions  The problems on this page are copyrighted by the Mathematical Association of America 's American Mathematics Competitions .

      " If we factor into irreducible polynomials (in $\\mathbb{Q}[x]$ ), each factor $f_i$ has exponent $1$ in the factorization and degree at most $2$ (since the $a+bi$ with $b\\ne0$ come in conjugate pairs with product $a^2+b^2$ ). Clearly we want the product of constant terms of these polynomials to equal $50$ ; for $d\\mid 50$ , let $f(d)$ be the number of permitted $f_i$ with constant term $d$ . It's easy to compute $f(1)=2$ , $f(2)=3$ , $f(5)=5$ , $f(10)=5$ , $f(25)=6$ , $f(50)=7$ , and obviously $f(d) = 1$ for negative $d\\mid 50$ . Note that by the distinctness condition, the only constant terms $d$ that can be repeated are those with $d^2\\mid 50$ and $f(d)>1$ , i.e. $+1$ and $+5$ . Also, the $+1$ s don't affect the product, so we can simply count the number of polynomials with no constant terms of $+1$ and multiply by $2^{f(1)} = 4$ at the end. We do casework on the (unique) even constant term $d\\in\\{\\pm2,\\pm10,\\pm50\\}$ in our product. For convenience, let $F(d)$ be the number of ways to get a product of $50/d$ without using $\\pm 1$ (so only using $\\pm5,\\pm25$ ) and recall $f(-1) = 1$ ; then our final answer will be $2^{f(1)}\\sum_{d\\in\\{2,10,50\\}}(f(-d)+f(d))(F(-d)+F(d))$ . It's easy to compute $F(-50)=0$ , $F(50)=1$ , $F(-10)=f(5)=5$ , $F(10)=f(-5)=1$ , $F(-2)=f(-25)+f(-5)f(5)=6$ , $F(2)=f(25)+\\binom{f(5)}{2}=16$ , so we get \\[4 [ (1+3)(6+16) + (1+5)(1+5) + (1+7)(0+1) ] = 4[132] = \\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }528}\\]  Disregard sign; we can tack on $x-1$ if the product ends up being negative. $1: \\pm i,-1$ (2) (1 is not included) $2: \\pm 2, \\pm 1\\pm i$ (4) $5: \\pm 2\\pm i, \\pm 1\\pm 2i, \\pm 5$ (6) $10: \\pm 3\\pm i, \\pm 1\\pm 3i, \\pm 10$ (6) $25: \\pm 25, \\pm 3\\pm 4i, \\pm 4\\pm 3i, \\pm 5i$ (7) $50: \\pm 50, \\pm 1\\pm 7i, \\pm7\\pm i, \\pm 5\\pm 5i$ (8) Our answer is $2^2\\left(4\\cdot\\binom{6}{2}+6\\cdot 6+4\\cdot 7+8\\right)=\\boxed{528.}$  By Vieta's formula $50$ is the product of all $n$ roots.

      " We need to multiply $b$ by $\\frac{d}{a}$ for the new cows and $\\frac{e}{c}$ for the new time, so the answer is $b\\cdot \\frac{d}{a}\\cdot \\frac{e}{c}=\\frac{bde}{ac}$ , or $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A) } \\frac{bde}{ac}}$ . We plug in $a=2$ , $b=3$ , $c=4$ , $d=5$ , and $e=6$ . Hence the question becomes \"2 cows give 3 gallons of milk in 4 days. How many gallons of milk do 5 cows give in 6 days?\" If 2 cows give 3 gallons of milk in 4 days, then 2 cows give $\\frac{3}{4}$ gallons of milk in 1 day, so 1 cow gives $\\frac{3}{4\\cdot2}$ gallons in 1 day. This means that 5 cows give $\\frac{5\\cdot3}{4\\cdot2}$ gallons of milk in 1 day. Finally, we see that 5 cows give $\\frac{5\\cdot3\\cdot6}{4\\cdot2}$ gallons of milk in 6 days. Substituting our values for the variables, this becomes $\\frac{dbe}{ac}$ , which is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A)}\\ \\frac{bde}{ac}}$ . We see that the number of cows is inversely proportional to the number of days and directly proportional to the gallons of milk. So our constant is $\\dfrac{ac}{b}$ . Let $g$ be the answer to the question. We have $\\dfrac{de}{g}=\\dfrac{ac}{b}\\implies gac=bde\\implies g=\\dfrac{bde}{ac}\\implies\\boxed{ \\textbf{(A)}\\ \\frac{bde}{ac}}$  The problem specifics \"rate,\" so it would be wise to first find the rate at which cows produce milk. We can find the rate of work/production by finding the gallons produced by a single cow in a single day. To do this, we divide the amount produced by the number of cows and number of days \\[\\implies\\text{rate}=\\dfrac{b}{ac}\\]  Now that we have the gallons produced by a single cow in a single day, we simply multiply that rate by the number of cows and the number of days \\[\\implies\\boxed{\\textbf{(A) } \\dfrac{bde}{ac}}\\]  If $a$ cows give $b$ gallons of milk in $c$ days, that means that one cow will give $\\frac{b}{a}$ gallons of milk in $c$ days. Also, we want to find the number of gallons of milk will $d$ cows give in $e$ days, so in $\\frac{e}{c}$ days $d$ cows give $\\frac{bd}{a}$ gallons of milk. Multiplying with the formula $d=rt$ , we get $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A) } \\dfrac{bde}{ac}}$  In the right formula, plugging in $d=a$ and $e=c$ should simplify to $b$ , as if it doesn't, we'd essentially be saying \" $a$ cows give $b$ gallons of milk in $c$ days, but $a$ cows don't give $b$ gallons of milk in $c$ days.\" The only one of the answer choices that simplifies like this is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A)}}$  Call the rate at which a single cow produces milk $r$ . Using the given information we get that $rac=b$ , and we want to find $rde$ . We solve for $r$ in the first equation to get $r=b \\cdot \\tfrac{1}{ac}$ . Plugging in this value for $r$ into the expression we want, we get that $rde=\\frac{bde}{ac}$ , or $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A)}}$ . https://youtu.be/4THtSkiSGMg  ~Education, the Study of Everything https://youtu.be/OW4rHUTPgPA  ~savannahsolver\n",

(Solution by AT) Taking the definition of an arithmetic progression, there must be a common difference between the terms, giving us $(b-a) = (c-b)$ . From this, we can obtain the expression $a = 2b-c$ . Again, by taking the definition of a geometric progression, we can obtain the expression, $c=ar$ and $b=ar^2$ , where r serves as a value for the ratio between two terms in the progression. By substituting $b$ and $c$ in the arithmetic progression expression with the obtained values from the geometric progression, we obtain the equation, $a=2ar^2-ar$ which can be simplified to $(r-1)(2r+1)=0$ giving us $r=1$ or $r=-1/2$ . Thus, from the geometric progression, $a=a$ , $b=1/4a$ and $c=-1/2a$ . Looking at the initial conditions of $a<b<c$ we can see that the lowest integer value that would satisfy the above expressions is if $a = -4$ , thus making $c=2$ or $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C)}}$ (Solution by thatuser) By the definition of an arithmetic progression, we can label the terms $a$ , $b$ , and $c$ , as $a$ , $a+d$ , and $a+2d$ . Now, we have that $a$ , $a+2d$ , and $a+d$ form a geometric progression. Since a geometric ratio has a common ratio between terms, we have $(a+2d)/a = (a+d)/a+2d$ . Cross multiplying, we obtain the equation $(a+2d)^2=a(a+d)$ . Multiplying it out and cancelling terms, we are left with the quadratic equation $4d^2+3ad=0$ . Solving for $d$ in terms of $a$ , we get that $d=-3a/4$ or $d=0$ . Looking at the problem, we know that the $d$ cannot be 0, therefore the arithmetic progression is $a, a/4, -a/2$ , so we need to find the minimum value of $-a/2$ while $-a/2>a$ . Looking at our progression, we realize that a must be a multiple of 4 so that every term is an integer. Substituting $a=-4$ , since that would yield the smallest value of $-a/2$ which satisfies the conditions, we figure out that the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C)}}$ .\n",

It just so happens that \\[(1+2+\\cdots+9)(100)(10^4+1)+(1+2+\\cdots+9)(90)(10^3+10)+(1+2+\\cdots+9)(90)(10^2)=49500000\\] so the sum of the digits of the sum is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B)}\\; 18}$ . Notice that $10001+ 99999 = 110000.$ In fact, ordering the palindromes in ascending order, we find that the sum of the nth palindrome and the nth to last palindrome is $110000.$ We have $9\\cdot 10\\cdot 10$ palindromes, or $450$ pairs of palindromes summing to $110000.$ Performing the multiplication gives $49500000$ , so the sum $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B)}\\; 18}$ . As shown above, there are a total of $900$ five-digit palindromes.  We can calculate their sum by finding the expected value of a randomly selected palindrome satisfying the conditions given, then multiplying it by $900$ to get our sum.  The expected value for the ten-thousands and the units digit is $\\frac{1+2+3+\\cdots+9}{9}=5$ , and the expected value for the thousands, hundreds, and tens digit is $\\frac{0+1+2+\\cdots+9}{10}=4.5$ .  Therefore our expected value is $5\\times10^4+4.5\\times10^3+4.5\\times10^2+4.5\\times10^1+5\\times10^0=55,\\!000$ .  Since the question asks for the sum of the digits of the resulting sum, we do not need to keep the trailing zeros of either $55,\\!000$ or $900$ .  Thus we only need to calculate $55\\times9=495$ , and the desired sum is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }18}$ . First, allow $a$ to be zero, and then subtract by how much we overcount. We'll also sum each palindrome with its $\\textit{complement}$ . If $\\overline{abcba}$ (the line means a, b, and c are digits and $abcba\\ne a\\cdot b\\cdot c\\cdot b\\cdot a$ ) is a palindrome, then its complement is $\\overline{defed}$ where $d=9-a$ , $e=9-b$ , $f=9-c$ . Notice how every palindrome has a unique compliment, and that the sum of a palindrome and its complement is $99999$ . Therefore, the sum of our palindromes is $99999\\times (10^3/2)$ . (There are $10^3/2$ pairs.) However, we have overcounted, as something like $05350$  $\\textit{isn't}$ a palindrome by the problem's definition, but we've still included it. So we must subtract the sum of numbers in the form $\\overline{0nmn0}$ . By the same argument as before, these sum to $9990\\times  (10^2/2)$ . Therefore, the sum that the problem asks for is: \\[500\\times99999-50\\times 9990\\]  \\[=500\\times99999-500\\times 999\\]  \\[=500(99999-999)\\]  \\[=500\\times 99000\\]  Since all we care about is the sum of the digits, we can drop the $0$ 's. \\[5\\times99\\]  \\[=5\\times(100-1)\\]  \\[=495\\]  And finally, $4+9+5=\\boxed{\\textbf{(B)}18}$ \n",

      " We can list the first few numbers in the form $8 \\cdot (8....8)$  (Hard problem to do without the multiplication, but you can see the pattern early on) $8 \\cdot 8 = 64$  $8 \\cdot 88 = 704$  $8 \\cdot 888 = 7104$  $8 \\cdot 8888 = 71104$  $8 \\cdot 88888 = 711104$  By now it's clear that the numbers will be in the form $7$ , $k-2$  $1$ 's, and $04$ . We want to make the numbers sum to 1000, so $7+4+(k-2) = 1000$ . Solving, we get $k = 991$ , meaning the answer is $\\fbox{(D)}$  Another way to proceed is that we know the difference between the sum of the digits of each product and $k$ is always $9$ , so we just do $1000-9=\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) } 991}$ . Proof of Solution 1 Since this solution won't fly on a proof-based competition, here's a proof that it's valid: We will call $x_k=8(888\\dots8)$ with exactly $k$  $8$ s. We then rewrite this more formally, as: \\[x_k=8\\biggr(\\sum_{n=0}^{k-1}8(10)^n\\biggr)\\]  \\[=64\\biggr(\\sum_{n=0}^{k-1}(10)^n\\biggr)\\]  \\[=64\\frac{10^{k}-1}{9}\\]  Then, finding a recursive formula, we get: \\[x_{k+1}=64\\times 10^{k}+x_k\\]  We will now use induction, Our base case will be $k=2$ . It's easy to see that this becomes $x_2=704$ . Then, the $k+1$ case: let $x_k=7111\\dots104$ with $k-2$  $1$ s. Then $x_{k+1}=64000\\dots000+7111\\dots104$ . Adding these numbers, we get $x_{k+1}=71111\\dots104$ . Summing these digits, we have $4+7+(k-2)=1000$ , giving us $k=991$ . We first note that $125 \\cdot 8 = 1000$ and so we assume there are $125$ 8s. Then we note that it is asking for the second factor, so we subtract $1$ (the original $8$ in the first factor). Now we have $125-1=124.$ The second factor is obviously a multiple of $124$ . Listing the first few, we have $124, 248, 372, 496, 620, 744, 868, 992, 1116, 1240, ...$  We notice that the 4th answer choice is 1 less than a 992(a multiple of 124.) Thus we make an educated guess that it is somehow less by 1, so we get $\\fbox{(D)}$ . ~mathboy282 Note (Must Read) We were just lucky; this method is NOT reliable.

This number will have $99$ ones (197 digits in total), as to be divisible by $9$ and $11$ . The enormity of this number forces us to look for a pattern, and so we divide out as shown. Indeed, upon division (seeing how the remainders always end in \"501\" or \"601\" or, at last, \"9801\"), we find the repeating part $.00010203040506070809101112131415....9799$ . If we wanted to further check our pattern, we could count the total number of digits in our quotient (not counting the first three): 195. Since $99<100$ , multiplying by it will produce either $1$ or $2$ extra digits, so our quotient passes the test. Or note that the 1 has to be carried when you get to 100 so the 99 becomes 00 and the 1 gets carried again to 98 which becomes 99.  https://artofproblemsolving.com/videos/amc/2014amc12a/382 \n",

      " The parabola is symmetric through $y=- \\frac{4}{3}x$ , and the common distance is $5$ , so the directrix is the line through $(1,7)$ and $(-7,1)$ , which is the line \\[3x-4y = -25.\\] Using the point-line distance formula, the parabola is the locus \\[x^2+y^2 = \\frac{\\left\\lvert 3x-4y+25 \\right\\rvert^2}{3^2+4^2}\\] which rearranges to $(4x+3y)^2 = 25(6x-8y+25)$ . Let $m = 4x+3y \\in \\mathbb Z$ , $\\left\\lvert m \\right\\rvert \\le 1000$ .  Put $m = 25k$ to obtain \\[25k^2 = 6x-8y+25\\] \\[25k = 4x+3y.\\] and accordingly we find by solving the system that $x = \\frac{1}{2} (3k^2-3) + 4k$ and $y = -2k^2+3k+2$ . One can show that the values of $k$ that make $(x,y)$ an integer pair are precisely odd integers $k$ .  For $\\left\\lvert 25k \\right\\rvert \\le 1000$ this is $k= -39,-37,-35,\\dots,39$ , so $40$ values work and the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B)}}$ . (Solution by C-273) The axis of $P$ is inclined at an angle $\\theta$ relative to the coordinate axis, where $\\tan\\theta = \\tfrac 34$ . We rotate the coordinate axis by angle $\\theta$ anti-clockwise, so that the parabola now has a vertical symmetry axis relative to the rotated coordinates. Let $(\\widetilde{x}, \\widetilde{y})$ be the coordinates in the rotated system. Then $(x,y)$ and $(\\widetilde{x}, \\widetilde{y})$ are related by \\begin{align}   \\nonumber x = \\widetilde{x}\\cos\\theta -\\widetilde{y}\\sin\\theta &= \\tfrac 45 \\widetilde{x} - \\tfrac 35 \\widetilde{y}, \\\\    y = \\widetilde{x}\\sin\\theta +\\widetilde{y}\\cos\\theta &= \\tfrac 35 \\widetilde{x} + \\tfrac 45 \\widetilde{y} \\end{align} In the rotated coordinate system, the parabola has focus at $(0,0)$ and the two points on it are at $(5,0)$ and $(-5,0)$ . Therefore, the directrix is $\\widetilde{y}=\\pm 5$ ; we can, WLOG, choose $\\widetilde{y}=-5$ . For a point on the parabola, it is equidistant from the focus and directrix, so the equation of the parabola is \\begin{align}\\tag{2}   \\widetilde{x}^2+\\widetilde{y}^2 = (\\widetilde{y}+5)^2 \\qquad  &\\Longrightarrow\\qquad \\widetilde{y} = \\tfrac{1}{10}(\\widetilde{x}^2-25) \\end{align} From $(1)$ we have $|4x+3y|=5\\widetilde{x}$ , so we need $|\\widetilde{x}|<200$ . Substituting $(2)$ in $(1)$ , we get \\begin{align*}   50x &= 40 \\widetilde{x} - 3 \\widetilde{x}^2 + 75, \\\\   50y &= 30 \\widetilde{x} + 4 \\widetilde{x}^2 - 100 \\end{align*} For $x$ to be an integer $\\widetilde{x}$ must be a multiple of 5; setting $\\widetilde{x}=5a$ we get \\[2x = 8a - 3 a^2 + 3\\] Now we need $a$ to be odd, i.e. $\\widetilde{x}=5a$ is an odd multiple of $5$ , in which case we get $y = 3 a + 2 a^2 - 2$ , which is also an integer. The values that satisfy the given conditions correspond to $\\widetilde{x}= \\{\\pm 5\\cdot (2k-1)\\mid k = 0, 1, \\ldots , 19 \\}={-195, -185, -175, ..., 195}$ , and there are $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B)} \\ 40}$ such numbers.

Since the mode is $8$ , we have to have at least $2$ occurrences of $8$ in the list. If there are $2$ occurrences of $8$ in the list, we will have $a, b, c, 8, 8, 9, f, g, h, i, j$ . In this case, since $8$ is the unique mode, the rest of the integers have to be distinct. So we minimize $a,b,c,f,g,h,i$ in order to maximize $j$ . If we let the list be $1,2,3,8,8,9,10,11,12,13,j$ , then $j = 11 \\times 10 - (1+2+3+8+8+9+10+11+12+13) = 33$ . Next, consider the case where there are $3$ occurrences of $8$ in the list. Now, we can have two occurrences of another integer in the list. We try $1,1,8,8,8,9,9,10,10,11,j$ . Following the same process as above, we get $j = 11 \\times 10 - (1+1+8+8+8+9+9+10+10+11) = 35$ .

      " Define $T$ to be the set of all integral triples $(a, b, c)$ such that $a \\ge b \\ge c$ , $b+c > a$ , and $a, b, c < 5$ .

Using the triangle inequality, we find \\[a+1 > b \\implies a>b-1\\]  \\[\\frac{1}{a}+\\frac{1}{b} > 1\\] In order for us the find the lowest possible value for $b$ , we try to create two degenerate triangles where the sum of the smallest two sides equals the largest side.\n",

Since $b>a>1$ , we know that $a,b,1$ must satisfy $a + 1 \\le b$ to be degenerate in the first scenario. Similarly, since $\\frac{1}{n} + 1 > 1$ for all positive integers $n$ , the only condition that is guaranteed to form a degenerate triangle from the second instance is $\\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{1}{b} \\le 1$ . Solving the second inequality for $a$ in terms of $b$ (for more-easily apparent inequality manipulation) yields $b\\ge \\frac{a}{a-1}$ . Notice that $b> a+1 \\ge \\frac{a}{a-1}$ for almost all positive real numbers $a>1$ (see note at the end). Thus, it suffices to solve the inequality $a+1 \\ge \\frac{a}{a-1}$ for $a$ whose only positive solution is $a \\ge \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}$ . Substituting back into the first inequality yields $\\boxed{b \\ge \\frac{3 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}}$ and thus the answer is $\\text{C}$ .

Clearly a triangle can't have negative area so, our triangle must have $0$ area which means equality must be obtained for all the inequalities above. Since $a = 1+b$ we know that $(1+b)^2 = b$ which simplifies to $b^2 - 3b + 1$ . Solving for $b$ we get $\\frac{3 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}$ . So the answer is C.\n",

      " Draw the altitude from $H$ to $AB$ and call the foot $L$ . Then $HL=1$ . Consider $HJ$ . It is the hypotenuse of both right triangles $\\triangle HGJ$ and $\\triangle HLJ$ , and we know $JG=HL=1$ , so we must have $\\triangle HGJ\\cong\\triangle JLH$ by Hypotenuse-Leg congruence. From this congruence we have $LJ=HG=BE$ . Notice that all four triangles in this picture are similar. Also, we have $LA=HD=EJ$ . So set $x=LJ=HG=BE$ and $y=LA=HD=EJ$ . Now $BE+EJ+JL+LA=2(x+y)=1$ . This means $x+y=\\frac{1}{2}=BE+EJ=BJ$ , so $J$ is the midpoint of $AB$ . So $\\triangle AJG$ , along with all other similar triangles in the picture, is a 30-60-90 triangle, and we have $AG=\\sqrt{3} \\cdot AJ=\\sqrt{3}/2$ and subsequently $GD=\\frac{2-\\sqrt{3}}{2}=KE$ . This means $EJ=\\sqrt{3} \\cdot KE=\\frac{2\\sqrt{3}-3}{2}$ , which gives $BE=\\frac{1}{2}-EJ=\\frac{4-2\\sqrt{3}}{2}=2-\\sqrt{3}$ , so the answer is $\\textbf{(C)}$ . Let $BE = x$ .  Let $JA = y$ .  Because $\\angle FKH = \\angle EJK = \\angle AGJ = \\angle DHG$ and $\\angle FHK = \\angle EKJ = \\angle AJG = \\angle DGH$ , $\\triangle KEJ, \\triangle JAG, \\triangle GDH, \\triangle HFK$ are all similar.  Using proportions and the pythagorean theorem, we find \\[EK = xy\\]  \\[FK = \\sqrt{1-y^2}\\]  \\[EJ = x\\sqrt{1-y^2}\\] Because we know that $BE+EJ+AJ = EK + FK = 1$ , we can set up a systems of equations and solving for $x$ , we get \\[x + x\\sqrt{1-y^2} + y = 1 \\implies x= \\frac{1-y}{1+\\sqrt{1-y^2}}\\]  \\[xy + \\sqrt{1-y^2} = 1 \\implies x= \\frac{1-\\sqrt{1-y^2}}{y}\\] Now solving for $y$ , we get \\[\\frac{1-y}{1+\\sqrt{1-y^2}}=\\frac{1-\\sqrt{1-y^2}}{y} \\implies y(1-y)=(1-\\sqrt{1-y^2})(1+\\sqrt{1-y^2}) \\implies y-y^2=y^2 \\implies y=\\frac{1}{2}\\] Plugging into the second equations with $x$ , we get \\[x= 2\\left(1-\\sqrt{1-\\frac{1}{4}}\\right) = 2\\left(\\frac{2-\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\right) = \\boxed{\\textbf{(C)}\\ 2-\\sqrt{3}}\\]  Let $BE = x$ , $EK = a$ , and $EJ = b$ .

The first and last roots are extraneous because they imply $a = 0$ and $x > 1$ , respectively, thus $x = \\boxed{\\textbf{(C)}\\ 2-\\sqrt{3}}$ . Let $\\angle FKH$ = $k$ and $CF$ = $a$ .  It is shown that all four triangles in the picture are similar.  From the square side lengths: \\[a + \\sin(k) \\cdot 1 + \\cos(k) \\cdot a = 1\\]  \\[\\sin(k)a + \\cos(k) = 1\\] Solving for $a$ we get: \\[a = \\frac{1-\\sin(k)}{\\cos(k) + 1} = \\frac{1 - \\cos(k)}{\\sin(k)}\\]  \\[(1-\\sin(k)) \\cdot sin(k) = (1 - \\cos(k))\\cdot(\\cos(k) + 1)\\]  \\[\\sin(k)-\\sin(k)^2 = \\cos(k) + 1 - \\cos(k)^2 - \\cos(k)\\]  \\[\\sin(k)-\\sin(k)^2 = \\sin(k)^2\\]  \\[1-\\sin(k) = \\sin(k)\\]  \\[\\sin(k) = \\frac{1}{2}, \\cos(k) = \\frac{\\sqrt 3}{2}\\]  \\[a = \\frac{1 - \\frac{\\sqrt 3}{2}}{\\frac{1}{2}} = 2 - \\sqrt 3\\]  Note that $HJ$ is a diagonal of $JKHG$ , so it must be equal in length to $FB$ . Therefore, quadrilateral $FHJB$ has $FH\\parallel BJ$ , and $FB=HJ$ , so it must be either an isosceles trapezoid or a parallelogram. But due to the slope of $FB$ and $HJ$ , we see that it must be a parallelogram. Therefore, $FH=BJ$ . But by the symmetry in rectangle $FEAD$ , we see that $FH=JA$ . Therefore, $BJ=FH=JA$ . We also know that $BJ+JA=1$ , hence $BJ=JA=\\frac12$ . As $JG=1$ and $JA=\\frac12$ , and as $\\triangle GJA$ is right, we know that $\\triangle GJA$ must be a 30-60-90 triangle. Therefore, $GA=\\sqrt{3}/2$ and $DG=1-\\sqrt{3}/2$ . But by similarity, $\\triangle DHG$ is also a 30-60-90 triangle, hence $DH=\\sqrt{3}-3/2$ . But $\\triangle DHG\\cong\\triangle EJK$ , hence $EJ=\\sqrt{3}-3/2$ . As $BJ=1/2$ , this implies that $BE=BJ-EJ=1/2-\\sqrt{3}+3/2=2-\\sqrt{3}$ . Thus the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C)}}$ .

Hence $P(1) = \\frac {1} {10}P(0) + \\frac {9} {10}P(2) = \\frac {9} {10}P(2)$  $\\Rightarrow P(2) = \\frac {10} {9}P(1)$  Returning to our original equation: $P(1) = \\frac {9} {10}P(2) = \\frac {9} {10}\\left(\\frac{2} {10}P(1) + \\frac{8} {10}P(3)\\right)$  $= \\frac {9} {50}P(1) + \\frac {18} {25}P(3) \\Rightarrow P(1) - \\frac {9} {50}P(1)$  $= \\frac {18} {25}P(3)$  $\\Rightarrow P(3) = \\frac {41} {36}P(1)$  Returning to our original equation: $P(1) = \\frac {9} {50}P(1) + \\frac {18} {25}\\left(\\frac {3} {10}P(2) + \\frac {7} {10}P(4)\\right)$  $= \\frac {9} {50}P(1) + \\frac {27} {125}P(2) + \\frac {63} {125}P(4)$  $= \\frac {9} {50}P(1) + \\frac {27} {125}\\left(\\frac {10} {9}P(1)\\right) + \\frac {63} {125}\\left(\\frac {4} {10}P(3) + \\frac {6} {10}P(5)\\right)$  Cleaing up the coefficients, we have: $= \\frac {21} {50}P(1) + \\frac {126} {625}P(3) + \\frac {189} {625}P(5)$  $= \\frac {21} {50}P(1) + \\frac {126} {625}\\left(\\frac {41} {36}P(1)\\right) + \\frac {189} {625}\\left(\\frac {1} {2}\\right)$  Hence, $P(1) = \\frac {525} {1250}P(1) + \\frac {287} {1250}P(1) + \\frac {189} {1250}$  $\\Rightarrow P(1) - \\frac {812} {1250}P(1) = \\frac {189} {1250} \\Rightarrow P(1) = \\frac {189} {438}$  $= \\boxed{\\frac {63} {146}\\, (C)}$  Or set $P(1)=a,P(2)=b,P(3)=c,P(4)=d,P(5)=e=1/2$ : \\[a=0.1\\emptyset+0.9b,b=0.2a+0.8c,c=0.3b+0.7d,d=0.4c+0.6e\\]  \\[10a=\\emptyset+9b,10b=2a+8c,10c=3b+7d,10d=4c+6e\\]  \\[\\implies b=\\frac{10a-\\emptyset}{9},c=\\frac{5b-a}{4},d=\\frac{10c-3b}{7},e=\\frac{5d-2c}{3}=1/2\\]  $b=\\frac{10a}{9}$  $c=\\frac{5\\left(\\frac{10a}{9}\\right)-a}{4}=\\frac{\\frac{50a}{9}-a}{9}=\\frac{41a}{36}$  $d=\\frac{10\\left(\\frac{41a}{36}\\right)-3\\left(\\frac{30a}{9}\\right)}{7}=\\frac{\\frac{205a}{18}-\\frac{10a}{3}}{7}=\\frac{145a}{126}$  $e=\\frac{5\\left(\\frac{145a}{126}\\right)-2\\left(\\frac{41a}{36}\\right)}{3}=\\frac{\\frac{725a}{126}-\\frac{41a}{18}}{3}=\\frac{73a}{63}$  Since $e=\\frac{1}{2}$ , $\\frac{73a}{63}=\\frac{1}{2}\\implies a=\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }\\frac{63}{146}}$ . Notice that the probabilities are symmetrical around the fifth lily pad. If the frog is on the fifth lily pad, there is a $\\frac{1}{2}$ chance that it escapes and a $\\frac{1}{2}$ chance that it gets eaten. Now, let $P_k$ represent the probability that the frog escapes if it is currently on pad $k$ . We get the following system of $5$ equations: \\[P_1=\\frac{9}{10}\\cdot P_2\\]  \\[P_2=\\frac{2}{10}\\cdot P_1 + \\frac{8}{10}\\cdot P_3\\]  \\[P_3=\\frac{3}{10}\\cdot P_2 + \\frac{7}{10}\\cdot P_4\\]  \\[P_4=\\frac{4}{10}\\cdot P_3 + \\frac{6}{10}\\cdot P_5\\]  \\[P_5=\\frac{5}{10}\\] We want to find $P_1$ , since the frog starts at pad $1$ . Solving the above system yields $P_1=\\frac{63}{146}$ , so the answer is $\\boxed{(C)}$ . System of equations (alligator112): Start by removing all fractions. From here on out, we will use substitution while avoiding fractions. \\[10P_1 = 9P_2\\]  \\[10P_2 = 2P_1 + 8P_3\\]  \\[10P_3 = 3P_2 + 7P_4\\]  \\[10P_4 = 4P_3 + 6P_5 = 4P_3 + 3\\]  \\[100 P_3 = 30P_2 + 70P_4 = 30P_2 + 7(4P_3 + 3) \\rightarrow 72P_3 = 30P_2 + 21\\]  \\[90P_2 = 18P_1 + 72P_3 = 18P_1 + 30P_2 + 21 \\rightarrow 60P_2 = 18P_1 + 21\\]  \\[200P_1 = 180P_2 = 3(18P_1 + 21) = 54P_1 + 63 \\rightarrow P_1 = \\frac{63}{146}\\]  Assign each lily pad a value, with pad $0$ having value $0$ and pad $i > 0$ having value $\\sum_{k=0}^{i-1}\\frac{1}{\\binom{9}{k}}$ . If we treat the process as a random walk $X_0, X_1, \\cdots$ over these values, note that $\\mathbb{E}[X_{n+1}] = n$ for all $n \\ge 0$ . This is purely by construction, as the expected gain at pad $k$ is $\\binom{9}{k}\\cdot \\frac{10-k}{10} - \\binom{9}{k-1}\\cdot \\frac{k}{10} = 0$ . Therefore the process is a martingale. Since the stopping time has finite expectation and the increments are bounded, the Optional Stopping Thoerem applies and the expected final outcome is $0$ . This gives the probability of reaching safety as $\\left(\\sum_{k=0}^{9}\\frac{1}{\\binom{9}{k}}\\right)^{-1} = \\frac{63}{146}$ , which is choice $\\boxed{(C)}$ . We can represent this problem with the following State Transition Digram of Absorbing Markov Chain . State $0$ and state $10$ are the absorbing states. This problem asks for the Absorbing Probability of state $10$ . Markov Chain Frog.png Let $p_{ij} = P(X_{n+1} = j | X_n = i)$ , the probability that state $i$ transits to state $j$ on the next step. Let $a_i$ be the absorbing probability of being absorbed in the absorbing state when starting from transient state $i$ . $a_i = \\sum_{j} (p_{ij} \\cdot a_{j})$  $a_i$ is the sum of the products of $p_{ij}$ and $a_j$ of all the next state $j$ . ~ isabelchen  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMdgh2mMiWM  https://youtu.be/QqeaomXYDsg  ~IceMatrix   2014 AMC 10B ( Problems • Answer Key • Resources )   Preceded by Problem 24   Followed by Last Question    1  •  2  •  3  •  4  •  5  •  6  •  7  •  8  •  9  •  10  •  11  •  12  •  13  •  14  •  15  •  16  •  17  •  18  •  19  •  20  •  21  •  22  •  23  •  24  •  25    All AMC 10 Problems and Solutions    2014 AMC 12B ( Problems • Answer Key • Resources )   Preceded by Problem 21   Followed by Problem 23    1  •  2  •  3  •  4  •  5  •  6  •  7  •  8  •  9  •  10  •  11  •  12  •  13  •  14  •  15  •  16  •  17  •  18  •  19  •  20  •  21  •  22  •  23  •  24  •  25    All AMC 12 Problems and Solutions  The problems on this page are copyrighted by the Mathematical Association of America 's American Mathematics Competitions .

We use the Law of Cosines on $\\triangle ABC$ to get $60\\cos\\theta = 109-c^2$ .  Eliminating $\\cos\\theta$ we get $c^3-109c-420=0$ which factorizes as \\[(c+7)(c+5)(c-12)=0.\\] Discarding the negative roots we have $c=12$ . Thus $BD=AC=CE=12$ . For $BE=a$ , we use Ptolemy's theorem on cyclic quadrilateral $ABCE$ to get $a=44/3$ . For $AD=b$ , we use Ptolemy's theorem on cyclic quadrilateral $ACDE$ to get $b=27/2$ . The sum of the lengths of the diagonals is $12+12+12+\\tfrac{44}{3}+\\tfrac{27}{2} = \\tfrac{385}{6}$ so the answer is $385 + 6 = \\fbox{\\textbf{(D) }391}$  Let $a$ denote the length of a diagonal opposite adjacent sides of length $14$ and $3$ , $b$ for sides $14$ and $10$ , and $c$ for sides $3$ and $10$ . Using Ptolemy's Theorem on the five possible quadrilaterals in the configuration, we obtain: \\begin{align} c^2 &= 3a+100 \\\\ c^2 &= 10b+9 \\\\ ab &= 30+14c \\\\ ac &= 3c+140\\\\ bc &= 10c+42 \\end{align}  Using equations $(1)$ and $(2)$ , we obtain: \\[a = \\frac{c^2-100}{3}\\]  and \\[b = \\frac{c^2-9}{10}\\]  Plugging into equation $(4)$ , we find that: \\begin{align*} \\frac{c^2-100}{3}c &= 3c + 140\\\\ \\frac{c^3-100c}{3} &= 3c + 140\\\\ c^3-100c &= 9c + 420\\\\ c^3-109c-420 &=0\\\\ (c-12)(c+7)(c+5)&=0 \\end{align*}  Or similarly into equation $(5)$ to check: \\begin{align*} \\frac{c^2-9}{10}c &= 10c+42\\\\ \\frac{c^3-9c}{10} &= 10c + 42\\\\ c^3-9c &= 100c + 420\\\\ c^3-109c-420 &=0\\\\ (c-12)(c+7)(c+5)&=0 \\end{align*}  $c$ , being a length, must be positive, implying that $c=12$ . In fact, this is reasonable, since $10+3\\approx 12$ in the pentagon with apparently obtuse angles. Plugging this back into equations $(1)$ and $(2)$ we find that $a = \\frac{44}{3}$ and $b= \\frac{135}{10}=\\frac{27}{2}$ . We desire $3c+a+b = 3\\cdot 12 + \\frac{44}{3} + \\frac{27}{2} = \\frac{216+88+81}{6}=\\frac{385}{6}$ , so it follows that the answer is $385 + 6 = \\fbox{\\textbf{(D) }391}$  Let us set $x$ to be $AC=BD=CE$ and $y$ to be $BE$ and $z$ to be $AD$ . It follow from applying Ptolemy's Theorem on $ABCD$ to get $x^2=9+10z$ . Applying Ptolemy's on $ACDE$ gives $xz=42+10x$ ; and applying Ptolemy's on $BCDE$ gives $x^2=100+3y$ . So, we have the have the following system of equations: \\begin{align} x^2 &= 9+10z \\\\ x^2 &= 100+3y \\\\ xz &= 42+10x \\end{align}  From $(3)$ , we have $42=(z-10)x$ . Isolating the x gives $x=\\dfrac{42}{z-10}$ . By setting $(1)$ and $(2)$ equal, we have $x^2=9+10z=100+3y$ . Manipulating it gives $3y=10z-91$ . Finally, plugging back into $(2)$ gives $x^2=100+10z-91=10z+9$ . Plugging in the $x=\\dfrac{42}{z-10}$ as well gives \\begin{align*} \\left(\\frac{42}{z-10}\\right)^2 &= 10z+9\\\\ 10z^3 - 191z^2 + 820z + 900 &= 1764\\\\ 10z^3 - 191z^2 + 820z - 864 &= 0\\\\ (5z-8)(2z-27)(z-4) &=0 \\end{align*}  It is impossible for $z<10$ for $x<0$ ; that means $z=\\frac{27}{2}$ . That means $x = 12$ and $y = \\frac{44}{3}$ . Thus, the sum of all diagonals is $3x+y+z = 3\\cdot 12 + \\frac{44}{3} + \\frac{27}{2} = 385/6$ , which implies our answer is $m+n = 385+6 = \\fbox{391 \\textbf{(D)}}$ . ~sml1809 2014AMC12BProblem24Solution4.png Let $BE = a$ , $AC = CE = BD = b$  By Ptolemy's theorem for quadrilateral $ABCE$ , $AB \\cdot CE + BC \\cdot AE = BE \\cdot AC$ , $3b + 140 = ab$ , $a = 3 + \\frac{140}{b}$  By Ptolemy's theorem for quadrilateral $BCDE$ , $CD \\cdot BE + BC \\cdot DE = BD \\cdot CE$ , $3a + 100 = b^2$  $3(3 + \\frac{140}{b}) + 100 = b^2$ , $b^3 - 109 b -420 = 0$ , $(b-12)(b+7)(b+5) = 0$ , $b = 12$  $a = 3 + \\frac{140}{12} = \\frac{44}{3}$  By Ptolemy's theorem for quadrilateral $ABDE$ , $AE \\cdot BD + AB \\cdot DE = AD \\cdot BE$ , $AD \\cdot a = 14b + 30$ , $AD = \\frac{27}{2}$  $\\frac{m}{n} = 12 + 12 + 12 + \\frac{44}{3} + \\frac{27}{2} = \\frac{385}{6}$ , $385 + 6 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(D) }391}$  ~ isabelchen    2014 AMC 12B ( Problems • Answer Key • Resources )   Preceded by Problem 23   Followed by Problem 25    1  •  2  •  3  •  4  •  5  •  6  •  7  •  8  •  9  •  10  •  11  •  12  •  13  •  14  •  15  •  16  •  17  •  18  •  19  •  20  •  21  •  22  •  23  •  24  •  25    All AMC 12 Problems and Solutions  The problems on this page are copyrighted by the Mathematical Association of America 's American Mathematics Competitions .

      " Rewrite $\\cos{4x} - 1$ as $2\\cos^2{2x} - 2$ .  Now let $a = \\cos{2x}$ , and let $b = \\cos{\\left( \\frac{2014\\pi^2}{x} \\right) }$ .  We have: \\[2a(a - b) = 2a^2 - 2\\]  Therefore, \\[ab = 1\\] . Notice that either $a = 1$ and $b = 1$ or $a = -1$ and $b = -1$ .  For the first case, $a = 1$ only when $x = k\\pi$ and $k$ is an integer. $b = 1$ when $\\frac{2014\\pi^2}{k\\pi}$ is an even multiple of $\\pi$ , and since $2014 = 2*19*53$ , $b =1$ only when $k$ is an odd divisor of $2014$ .  This gives us these possible values for $x$ : \\[x= \\pi, 19\\pi, 53\\pi, 1007\\pi\\] For the case where $a = -1$ , $\\cos{2x} = -1$ , so $x = \\frac{m\\pi}{2}$ , where m is odd. $\\frac{2014\\pi^2}{\\frac{m\\pi}{2}}$ must also be an odd multiple of $\\pi$ in order for $b$ to equal $-1$ , so $\\frac{4028}{m}$ must be odd.  We can quickly see that dividing an even number by an odd number will never yield an odd number, so there are no possible values for $m$ , and therefore no cases where $a = -1$ and $b = -1$ . Therefore, the sum of all our possible values for $x$ is \\[\\pi + 19\\pi + 53\\pi + 1007\\pi = \\boxed{\\textbf{(D)}\\ 1080 \\pi}\\]  Very similar to the solution above, re-write the expression using $\\cos 4x = 2 \\cos^2 2x - 1$ : \\[2\\cos2x \\left(\\cos2x - \\cos{\\left( \\frac{2014\\pi^2}{x} \\right) } \\right) = 2 \\cos^2 2x - 2\\]  Now, expand the LHS and cancel terms: \\[2 \\cos^2 2x - 2 \\cos 2x \\cos{\\left( \\frac{2014\\pi^2}{x} \\right) } = 2 \\cos^2 2x - 2\\]  \\[\\cos 2x \\cos{\\left( \\frac{2014\\pi^2}{x} \\right) } = 1\\]  Now we use product-to-sum identities to get: \\[\\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\cos{2x + \\left( \\frac{2014\\pi^2}{x} \\right) } + \\cos{2x + \\left( \\frac{2014\\pi^2}{x} \\right) } \\right) = 1\\]  \\[\\cos{2x + \\left( \\frac{2014\\pi^2}{x} \\right) } + \\cos{2x + \\left( \\frac{2014\\pi^2}{x} \\right) } = 1\\]  Notice that for any $\\theta$ , $\\max{\\cos \\theta} = 1$ . This is achieved when $\\theta = 0$ , or equivalently \\[2x - \\frac{2014\\pi^2}{x} \\equiv 0 \\mod 2\\pi\\]  We can cleverly assume $x=c\\pi$ for some real $c$ . Then, we must have \\[2c - \\frac{2014}{c} \\equiv 0 \\mod 2\\]  In order for this to be satisfied, $\\frac{2014}{c}$ must be an even integer. Factoring $2014 = 2 \\cdot 19 \\cdot 53$ , we see that $c$ must be a positive odd integer that divides $2014$ . Our only positive valid $c$ are $c = 1, 19, 53, 1007$ . Our answer is just $\\pi(1+19+53+1007) = 1080\\pi \\implies \\textbf{(D)}$ . -FIREDRAGONMATH16 Rewriting $\\cos{4x} - 1$ as $2\\cos^2{2x} - 2$ and transposing $2\\cos{2x}$ from the LHS to the RHS, we get, \\[\\cos{2x} - \\cos{\\left(\\frac{2014\\pi^2}{x}\\right)} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\cos{2x}}\\]  \\[\\implies \\underbrace{\\cos{2x} + \\frac{1}{\\cos{2x}}}_{\\text{LHS}} = \\underbrace{1 + \\cos{\\left(\\frac{2014\\pi^2}{x}\\right)}}_{\\text{RHS}}\\]  By the AM-GM Inequality , \\[\\cos{2x} + \\frac{1}{\\cos{2x}} \\in (-\\infty, -2] \\cup [2, \\infty)\\]  Also, because of the range of $\\cos$ , \\[1 + \\cos{\\left(\\frac{2014\\pi^2}{x}\\right)} \\in [0, 2]\\]  Hence, $\\text{LHS} = \\text{RHS} = 2$ , and we get ( $m, n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ ), $\\cos{2x} = 1 \\implies x = m\\pi \\hspace{75pt} \\cdots\\cdots (1)$  $\\cos{\\left(\\frac{2014\\pi^2}{x}\\right)} = 1 \\implies x = \\frac{1007\\pi}{n} \\hspace{22pt} \\cdots\\cdots (2)$ From $(1)$ and $(2)$ , \\[m = \\frac{1007}{n}\\]  \\[\\implies m \\in \\{1, 19, 53, 1007\\}\\]  \\[\\implies x \\in \\{1\\pi, 19\\pi, 53\\pi, 1007\\pi\\}\\]  Therefore, sum of values of $x$ is \\[\\pi + 19\\pi + 53\\pi + 1007\\pi = \\boxed{\\textbf{(D)}\\ 1080\\pi}\\] . ~ plusone    2014 AMC 12B ( Problems • Answer Key • Resources )   Preceded by Problem 24   Followed by Last Question    1  •  2  •  3  •  4  •  5  •  6  •  7  •  8  •  9  •  10  •  11  •  12  •  13  •  14  •  15  •  16  •  17  •  18  •  19  •  20  •  21  •  22  •  23  •  24  •  25    All AMC 12 Problems and Solutions  The problems on this page are copyrighted by the Mathematical Association of America 's American Mathematics Competitions .

      " We can rewrite the fraction as $\\frac{123456789}{2^{22} \\cdot 10^4} = \\frac{12345.6789}{2^{22}}$ . Since the last digit of the numerator is odd, a $5$ is added to the right if the numerator is divided by $2$ , and this will continuously happen because $5$ , itself, is odd. Indeed, this happens twenty-two times since we divide by $2$ twenty-two times, so we will need $22$ more digits. Hence, the answer is $4 + 22 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(C)}\\ 26}$  Multiply the numerator and denominator of the fraction by $5^{22}$ (which is the same as multiplying by 1) to give $\\frac{5^{22} \\cdot 123456789}{10^{26}}$ . Now, instead of thinking about this as a fraction, think of it as the division calculation $(5^{22} \\cdot 123456789) \\div 10^{26}$ . The dividend is a huge number, but we know it doesn't have any digits to the right of the decimal point. Also, the dividend is not a multiple of 10 (it's not a multiple of 2), so these 26 divisions by 10 will each shift the entire dividend one digit to the right of the decimal point. Thus, $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C)}\\ 26}$ is the minimum number of digits to the right of the decimal point needed. The denominator is $10^4 \\cdot 2^{22}$ . Each $10$ adds one digit to the right of the decimal, and each additional $2$ adds another digit. The answer is $4 + 22 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(C)}\\ 26}$ . First, we can write the denominator as $2^{22}\\cdot 10^4$ and forget about the $10^4$ (however, we will need to add $4$ back to our final answer). Noticing that $2^{22}=\\left(2^{11} \\right)^2=2048^2,$ we divide 123456789 by 2048 using long division. We get 60281.63525390625 as the result (though the process seems intimidating, it actually doesn't take that long, just a couple of minutes). From there, we notice that there are 11 places after the decimal point in the quotient, which means there will be another 11 after we divide this quotient by 2048 again. So, there will be $22$ places after the decimal in the final quotient. We add back $4$ for a total of $26.$ \n",

      " The problem asks us to find the sum of every integer value of $a$ such that the roots of $x^2 - ax + 2a = 0$ are both integers. The quadratic formula gives the roots of the quadratic equation: $x=\\frac{a\\pm\\sqrt{a^2-8a}}{2}$  As long as the numerator is an even integer, the roots are both integers. But first of all, the radical term in the numerator needs to be an integer; that is, the discriminant $a^2 - 8a$ equals $k^2$ , for some nonnegative integer $k$ . $a^2-8a=k^2$  $a(a-8)=k^2$  $((a-4)+4)((a-4)-4)=k^2$  $(a-4)^2-4^2=k^2$  $(a-4)^2=k^2+4^2$  From this last equation, we are given a hint of the Pythagorean theorem. Thus, $(k,4,|a-4|)$ must be a Pythagorean triple unless $k = 0$ . In the case $k=0$ , the equation simplifies to $|a-4|=4$ . From this equation, we have $a=0,8$ . For both $a=0$ and $a=8$ , $\\frac{a\\pm\\sqrt{a^2-8a}}{2}$ yields two integers, so these values satisfy the constraints from the original problem statement. (Note: the two zero roots count as \"two integers.\") If $k$ is a positive integer, then only one Pythagorean triple could match the triple $(k,4,|a - 4|)$ because the only Pythagorean triple with a $4$ as one of the values is the classic $(3,4,5)$ triple. Here, $k=3$ and $|a-4|=5$ . Hence, $a=-1,9$ . Again, $\\frac{a\\pm\\sqrt{a^2-8a}}{2}$ yields two integers for both $a=-1$ and $a=9$ , so these two values also satisfy the original constraints. There are a total of four possible values for $a$ : $-1,0,8,$ and $9$ . Hence, the sum of all of the possible values of $a$ is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }16}$ .  By the quadratic formula, the roots $r$ can be represented by \\[r=\\frac{a\\pm\\sqrt{a^2-8a}}{2}\\] For $r\\in\\mathbb{Z}$ , $a\\in\\mathbb{Z}$ , since $\\frac{\\sqrt{a^2-8a}}{2}$ and $\\frac{a}{2}$ will have different mantissas (mantissae?). Now observe the discriminant $\\sqrt{a^2-8a}=\\sqrt{a(a-8)}$ and have two cases.  Positive $a$  $a\\geq8$ and $a\\leq0$ , since $1\\geq a \\geq7$ gives imaginary roots. Testing positive $a$ values, quickly see that $a\\leq9$ . After $16$ and $36$ , the difference between the closest nonzero factor pairs of perfect squares exceeds $8$ . For $8\\geq a \\geq9$ , $a=8,9$ . Checking both yields an integer. Negative $a$  We can instead test with $\\sqrt{-a(8-a)}$ . If $b=8-a$ , we have our original expression. Thus, for the same reasons, $b=8,9\\implies 8,9=8-a$ . $a=-1$ (0 does not affect the answer).  $-1+8+9=16\\implies\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }16}$  (Solution by BJHHar) Let $m$ and $n$ be the roots of $x^2-ax+2a$  By Vieta's Formulas, $n+m=a$ and $mn=2a$  Substituting gets us $n+m=\\frac{mn}{2}$  $2n-mn+2m=0$  Using Simon's Favorite Factoring Trick: $n(2-m)+2m=0$  $-n(2-m)-2m=0$  $-n(2-m)-2m+4=4$  $(2-n)(2-m)=4$  This means that the values for $(m,n)$ are $(0,0),(4,4),(3,6),(1,-2)$ giving us $a$ values of $-1,0,8,$ and $9$ . Adding these up gets $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }16}$ . The quadratic formula gives \\[x = \\frac{a \\pm \\sqrt{a(a-8)}}{2}\\] . For $x$ to be an integer, it is necessary (and sufficient!) that $a(a-8)$ to be a perfect square. So we have $a(a-8) = b^2$ ; this is a quadratic in itself and the quadratic formula gives \\[a = 4 \\pm \\sqrt{16 + b^2}\\]  We want $16 + b^2$ to be a perfect square. From smartly trying small values of $b$ , we find $b = 0, b = 3$ as solutions, which correspond to $a = -1, 0, 8, 9$ . These are the only ones; if we want to make sure then we must hand check up to $b=8$ . Indeed, for $b \\geq 9$ we have that the differences between consecutive squares are greater than $16$ so we can't have $b^2 + 16$ be a perfect square. So summing our values for $a$ we find $\\boxed{16 \\textbf{ (C)}}$ . as the answer. Additional note: You can use the quadratic and plug in squares for a (since for $b^2$ to be an integer $a$ would have to be some square), and eventually you can notice a limit to get the answer~  First of all, we know that $a$ is the sum of the quadratic's two roots, by Vieta's formulas. Thus, $a$ must be an integer. Then, we notice that the discriminant $a^2-8a$ must be equal to a perfect square so that the roots are integers. Thus, $a(a-8)=b^2$ where $b$ is an integer. We can complete the square and rearrange to get $(a-4)^2-b^2=16$ . Let's define $m=a-4$ , just to make things a little easier to write, so now we have $(m+b)(m-b)=16$ . We can now list out the integer factor pairs of 16 and the resulting values of $m$ and $b$ . (Note that $m$ and $b$ must both be integers)  $(m+b)(m-b)=16$  $16*1=16$  $\\Rightarrow$ Doesn't work $8*2=16$  $\\Rightarrow$  $m=5, b=3$  $4*4=16$  $\\Rightarrow$  $m=4, b=0$  $2*8=16$  $\\Rightarrow$  $m=5, b=-3$  $1*16=16$  $\\Rightarrow$ Doesn't work $-16*-1=16$  $\\Rightarrow$ Doesn't work $-8*-2=16$  $\\Rightarrow$  $m=-5, b=-3$  $-4*-4=16$  $\\Rightarrow$  $m=-4, b=0$  $-2*-8=16$  $\\Rightarrow$  $m=-5, b=-3$  $-1*-16=16$  $\\Rightarrow$ Doesn't work We want the possible values of $m$ , which are $-5,-4,4,$ and $5$ . As $m+4=a$ , $a$ can equal $-1,0,8,$ or $9.$ Adding all of that up gets us our answer, $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }16}$ . (Solution by Curious_crow)\n",

Thus $2a + b = 18$ , so $2a = 18 - b$ . Thus $12 = \\dfrac{1}{2} b \\sqrt{a^2 - (\\dfrac{b}{2})^2}$ , so $48 = b \\sqrt{4a^2 - b^2} = b \\sqrt{(18 - b)^2 - b^2} = b \\sqrt{324 - 36b}$ . We square and divide 36 from both sides to obtain $64 = b^2 (9 - b)$ , so $b^3 - 9b^2 + 64 = 0$ . Since we know $b = 8$ is a solution, we divide by $b - 8$ to get the other solution. Thus, $b^2 - b - 8 = 0$ , so $b = \\dfrac{1 + \\sqrt{33}}{2} < \\dfrac{1 + 6}{2} = 3.5.$ The answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A) }3}$ .

Squaring both sides and simplifying, we have $-b^3+9b^2-64=0$ . Since we know $b = 8$ is a solution, we divide by $b - 8$ to get the other solution. Thus, $b^2 - b - 8 = 0$ , so $b = \\dfrac{1 + \\sqrt{33}}{2} < \\dfrac{1 + 6}{2} = 3.5.$ The answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A) }3}$ .

If $b \\geq 3.5$ , then we would round up to 4, but if $b < 3.5$ , then we would round down to 3. So let us plug in 3.5 for $b$ . We get $67.375$ which is too high, so we know that $b < 3.5$ . Thus the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A) }3}$  For this new triangle, say its legs have length $d$ and the base length $2c$ . To see why I did this, draw the triangle on a Cartesian plane where the altitude is part of the y-axis! Then, we notice that $c+d=9$ and $c*\\sqrt{d^2-c^2}=12$ . It's better to let a side be some variable so we avoid having to add non-square roots and square-roots!! Now, modify the square-root equation with $d=9-c$ ; you get $c^2*(81-18c)=144$ , so $-18c^3+81c^2=144$ . Divide by $-9$ to get $2c^3-9c^2+16=0$ .

      " We can graph the ellipse by seeing that the center is $(0, 0)$ and finding the ellipse's intercepts. The points where the ellipse intersects the coordinate axes are $(0, 1), (0, -1), (4, 0)$ , and $(-4, 0)$ . Recall that the two foci lie on the major axis of the ellipse and are a distance of $c$ away from the center of the ellipse, where $c^2 = a^2 - b^2$ , with $a$ being half the length of the major (longer) axis and $b$ being half the minor (shorter) axis of the ellipse. We have that $c^2 = 4^2 - 1^2 \\implies$  $c^2 = 15 \\implies c = \\pm \\sqrt{15}$ . Hence, the coordinates of both of our foci are $(\\sqrt{15}, 0)$ and $(-\\sqrt{15}, 0)$ . In order for a circle to pass through both of these foci, we must have that the center of this circle lies on the y-axis. The minimum possible value of $r$ belongs to the circle whose diameter's endpoints are the foci of this ellipse, so $a = \\sqrt{15}$ . The value for $b$ is achieved when the circle passes through the foci and only three points on the ellipse, which is possible when the circle touches $(0, 1)$ or $(0, -1)$ . Which point we use does not change what value of $b$ is attained, so we use $(0, -1)$ . Here, we must find the point $(0, y)$ such that the distance from $(0, y)$ to both foci and $(0, -1)$ is the same. Now, we have the two following equations. \\[(\\sqrt{15})^2 + (y)^2 = b^2\\]  \\[y + 1 = b \\implies y = b - 1\\] Substituting for $y$ , we have that \\[15 + (b - 1)^2 = b^2 \\implies -2b + 16 = 0.\\]  Solving the above simply yields that $b = 8$ , so our answer is $a + b = \\sqrt{15} + 8 \\textbf{ (D)}$ . As above, we can show that the foci of the ellipse are $(\\sqrt{15},0), (-\\sqrt{15},0).$  To obtain the lower bound, note that the smallest circle is when the diameter is on the line segment formed by the two foci. We can check that this indeed passes through four points on the ellipse since $\\sqrt{15}>1,$ so $a=\\sqrt{15}.$  To get the upper bound, note that the circle must go through either $(0,1)$ or $(0,-1).$ WLOG, let let the circle go through $(0,1).$ We know that the circle must go through the foci of the ellipse $(\\sqrt{15},0), (-\\sqrt{15},0),$ So we can apply power of a point to find the diameter. Let $x$ denote the length of the line segment from the origin to the lower point on the circle. Note that $x$ lies on the diameter. Then by POP, we have $x \\cdot 1 = \\sqrt{15} \\cdot \\sqrt{15},$ yielding $x=15$ , and so the radius of the circle is $(15+1)/2=8,$ so $b=8.$ Thus $a+b=\\sqrt{15}+8 \\textbf{ (D)}$ . ~ ccx09 (Roy Boy Apple Short Long) The foci are at $(\\pm\\sqrt{15}, 0)$ . A circle that goes through these points is centered at $(0,n)$ . Then, the radius is $\\sqrt{n^2+15}$ , so the circle is in the form $x^2+(y-n)^2=n^2+15$ . WLOG, assume $n$ is positive. For the circle to hit the ellipse four times, $\\sqrt{n^2+15}>n+1$ ( $n+1$ being the distance between the circle's center and the farthest end of the ellipse that lies on the y-axis). Both sides are evidently positive, so we can square both sides, leaving $n^2+15>n^2+2n+1 \\implies n<7$ . The function for the radius $\\sqrt{n^2+15}$ is always increasing as $n$ increases right of $n=0$ and as $n$ decreases left of $n=0$ . So the minimum of the radius is $a=\\sqrt{0^2+15}=\\sqrt{15}$ and the maximum is less than $\\sqrt{7^2+15}=8$ . Thus, $\\sqrt{15}+8 \\implies \\textbf{(D)}$ . ~BJHHar Note, this is not a full solution but can be used if one is running out of time. As above, the minimum radius of the circle is $\\sqrt{15}$ which is the $a$ value.

      " One method of approach is to find a recurrence for $S(n)$ . Let us define $A(n)$ as the number of sequences of length $n$ ending with an $A$ , and $B(n)$ as the number of sequences of length $n$ ending in $B$ . Note that $A(n) = B(n)$ and $S(n) = A(n) + B(n)$ , so $S(n) = 2A(n)$ . For a sequence of length $n$ ending in $A$ , it must be a string of $A$ s appended onto a sequence ending in $B$ of length $n-1, n-2, \\text{or}\\ n-3$ . So we have the recurrence: \\[A(n) = B(n-1) + B(n-2) + B(n-3) = A(n-1) + A(n-2) + A(n-3)\\]  We can thus begin calculating values of $A(n)$ . We see that the sequence goes (starting from $A(0) = 1$ ): $1,1,2,4,7,13,24...$  A problem arises though: the values of $A(n)$ increase at an exponential rate. Notice however, that we need only find $S(2015)\\ \\text{mod}\\ 12$ . In fact, we can use the fact that $S(n) = 2A(n)$ to only need to find $A(2015)\\ \\text{mod}\\ 6$ . Going one step further, we need only find $A(2015)\\ \\text{mod}\\ 2$ and $A(2015)\\ \\text{mod}\\ 3$ to find $A(2015)\\ \\text{mod}\\ 6$ . Here are the values of $A(n)\\ \\text{mod}\\ 2$ , starting with $A(0)$ : \\[1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0...\\]  Since the period is $4$ and $2015 \\equiv 3\\ \\text{mod}\\ 4$ , $A(2015) \\equiv 0\\ \\text{mod}\\ 2$ . Similarly, here are the values of $A(n)\\ \\text{mod}\\ 3$ ,  starting with $A(0)$ : \\[1,1,2,1,1,1,0,2,0,2,1,0,0,1,1,2...\\]  Since the period is $13$ and $2015 \\equiv 0\\ \\text{mod}\\ 13$ , $A(2015) \\equiv 1\\ \\text{mod}\\ 3$ . Knowing that $A(2015) \\equiv 0\\ \\text{mod}\\ 2$ and $A(2015) \\equiv 1\\ \\text{mod}\\ 3$ , we see that $A(2015) \\equiv 4\\ \\text{mod}\\ 6$ , and $S(2015) \\equiv 8\\ \\text{mod}\\ 12$ . Hence, the answer is $\\textbf{(D)}$ . Note that instead of introducing $A(n)$ and $B(n)$ , we can simply write the relation $S(n)=S(n-1)+S(n-2)+S(n-3),$ and proceed as above. The huge $n$ value in place, as well as the \"no more than... in a row\" are key phrases that indicate recursion is the right way to go. \n",

      "So how can we make the words of $S(n)$ ? Do we choose 3-in-a-row of one letter, $A$ or $B$ , or do we want $2$ consecutive ones or $1$ ? Note that this covers all possible cases of ending with $A$ and $B$ with a certain number of consecutive letters. And obviously they are all distinct. [Convince yourself that each case for $S(n)$ is considered exactly once by using these cues: does it end in $3$ , $2$ , or $1$ consecutive letter(s) ( $1$ consecutive means a string like ... $BA$ , ... $AB$ , as in the letter switches) and does it $WLOG$ consider both $A$ and $B?$ ] From there we realize that $S(n)=S(n-1)+S(n-2)+S(n-3)$ because 3 in a row requires $S(n-3)$ , and so on. We need to find $S(2015)$ mod 12. We first compute $S(2015)$ mod $3$ and mod $4$ . By listing out the residues mod $3$ , we find that the cycle length for mod $3$ is $13$ . $2015$ is $0$ mod $13$ so $S(2015) = S(13) = 2$ mod $3$ . By listing out the residues mod $4$ , we find that the cycle length for mod $4$ is $4$ . S(2015) = S(3) = mod $4$ . By Chinese Remainder Theorem, $S(2015) =\\boxed{8}$ mod $12$ . We can start off by finding patterns in $S(n)$ . When we calculate a few values we realize either from performing the calculation or because the calculation was performed in the exact same way that $S(n) = 2^n - 2((n_4)- (n_5) \\dots (n_n))$ . Rearranging the expression we realize that the terms aside from $2^{2015}$ are congruent to $0$ mod $12$ (Just put the equation in terms of $2^{2015}$ and the four combinations excluded and calculate the combinations mod $12$ ). Using patterns we can see that $2^{2015}$ is congruent to $8$ mod $12$ . Therefore $\\boxed {8}$ is our answer.\n",

      " Divide the boundary of the square into halves, thereby forming 8 segments. Without loss of generality, let the first point $A$ be in the bottom-left segment. Then, it is easy to see that any point in the 5 segments not bordering the bottom-left segment will be distance at least $\\dfrac{1}{2}$ apart from $A$ . Now, consider choosing the second point on the bottom-right segment. The probability for it to be distance at least 0.5 apart from $A$ is $\\dfrac{0 + 1}{2} = \\dfrac{1}{2}$ because of linearity of the given probability. (Alternatively, one can set up a coordinate system and use geometric probability.) If the second point $B$ is on the left-bottom segment, then if $A$ is distance $x$ away from the left-bottom vertex, then $B$ must be at least $\\dfrac{1}{2} - \\sqrt{0.25 - x^2}$ away from that same vertex. Thus, using an averaging argument we find that the probability in this case is \\[\\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{2}^2} \\int_0^{\\frac{1}{2}} \\dfrac{1}{2} - \\sqrt{0.25 - x^2} dx = 4\\left(\\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{\\pi}{16}\\right) = 1 - \\frac{\\pi}{4}.\\]  (Alternatively, one can equate the problem to finding all valid $(x, y)$ with $0 < x, y < \\dfrac{1}{2}$ such that $x^2 + y^2 \\ge \\dfrac{1}{4}$ , i.e. (x, y) is outside the unit circle with radius 0.5.) Thus, averaging the probabilities gives \\[P = \\frac{1}{8} \\left(5 + \\frac{1}{2} + 1 - \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) = \\frac{1}{32} (26 - \\pi).\\]  Our answer is $\\textbf{(A)}$ . Fix one of the points on a SIDE. There are three cases: the other point is on the same side, an adjacent side, or the opposite side, with probability $0.25, 0.5, 0.25$ , respectively. Opposite side: Probability is obviously $1$ , no matter what. Same side: Pretend the points are on a line with coordinates $x$ and $y$ . If $|a-b| \\le \\frac{1}{2}$ , drawing a graph will give probability $\\frac{1}{4}$ . Adjacent side: superimpose a coordinate system over the points; call them $(x, 0)$ and $(0, y)$ . WLOG set $x, y >= 0$ and $x, y <= 1$ . We need $x^2+y^2>0.25$ , and drawing the coordinate system with bounds $(0, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1)$ gives probability $1-\\frac{\\pi}{16}$ that the distance between the points is $>0.5$ . Adding these up and finding the fraction gives us $\\frac{1}{32} (26 - \\pi)$ for an answer of $\\textbf{(A)}\\ 59$ . WLOG, let the first point be on the bottom side of the square. The points where the second point could exist are outside a circle of radius 0.5 centered on the first point. The parts of the square that lie in this circle are the distance from the point to the closest side of the square $n$ , the distance from the point to the outside of the circle (the radius $0.5$ ), and any portion of the nearest side that lies within the circle as represented by the Pythagorean Theorem $\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4}-n^2}$ . Thus, the total length the second point can exist in can be represented by $f(n)=4-(0.5+n+\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4}-n^2})$ . Distributing, $f(n)=3.5-n-\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4}-n^2}$ . Then, we can find the average of this function through calculus (wow more calc?). This formula is as follows, \\[\\frac{1}{a_{f} -a_{i}} \\int_{a_{i}}^{a_{f}} f(x)\\;dx\\]  For this case, the limits of integration are $0$ and $0.5$ ( $0\\leq n\\leq 0.5$ ). Then, we have, \\[2\\int_{0}^{\\frac{1}{2}} 3.5-n-\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4}-n^2}\\;dn\\]  \\[2(\\int_{0}^{\\frac{1}{2}} 3.5\\;dn -\\int_{0}^{\\frac{1}{2}}n\\;dn -\\int_{0}^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{4}-n^2}\\;dn)\\]   Even if you don't know how to integrate, as long as you know the idea of integration, you can figure these out. Graphing the first two, you can see that the first is a rectangle of length $0.5$ and width $3.5$ . The second is an isosceles right triangle of leg length $0.5$ . \\[\\int_{0}^{\\frac{1}{2}} 3.5\\;dn=\\frac{7}{4}, \\int_{0}^{\\frac{1}{2}}n\\;dn=\\frac{1}{8}\\]  Recognize that the third integral is a semicircle of radius $0.5$ and centered at the origin. This is where $\\pi$ comes in.

Do note that this is for those that have a limited knowledge of integration or those that have little time but are being very clever. Overall, where second point could lie to satisfy the problem is a length of $2(\\frac{7}{4}-\\frac{\\pi}{16}-\\frac{1}{8})=\\frac{26-\\pi}{8}$ . By contrast, the total length where it could lie is the perimeter of the square $4$ .

Notice that each segment is the same, so WLOG use any one of them. For the purposes of this solution, I will assume the segment we use starts at (0, 0) and ends at (0.5, 0). The square I use will have vertices of $(0,0)$ , $(1,0)$ , $(0,1)$ , and $(1,1)$ . A way we can figure out when the distance is at least $0.5$ is if we figure out when it isn't $0.5$ . Let's pick a point on our segment and denote it with $(x, 0)$ . Then, there are three ways a second point can be within the boundaries of this first point. Either, it is to the left of it (if possible), to the right of it, or it is on the segment that forms a right angle with it. Obviously, there is $x$ distance if the point is to the left of the point $x$ . Since we denoted this segment to be from $0$ to $0.5$ , then there will always be $0.5$ distance to the right of the point $x$ (as that's the maximum that we are trying to figure out). The difficult part is finding the total length on the segment that is perpendicular to our segment. However, since the square has a right angle, we can first find that the segment should have a length of $\\sqrt{0.25-x^2}$ (by the Pythagorean theorem, with hypotenuse 0.5 and one leg being x). Now that we have our three distances, all we need to do is find the average value of them. We can best do this with \"Integral/Interval\", and so we take the integral from $0$ to $0.5$ of $x+0.5+\\sqrt{0.25-x^2}$ and then divide it by $0.5$ (the interval). To integrate $\\sqrt{0.25-x^2}$ by hand, we want to pull out the $1/4$ , and then apply u-sub and our integration rules to find the answer. We get $0.75 - \\frac{\\pi}{16} \\cdot 2$ . Simplify this into $\\frac{6-\\pi}{8}$ . Now we are on our last stage. Proceed to make this equivalent to what the question is asking, as we have found the probability that the second point is within a distance of $0.5$ , whereas the question asks for at least a distance of $0.5$ (so more than). We can do this simply by doing $4- \\frac{6-\\pi}{8}$ (as $4$ is the total amount of length). This equates to $\\frac{26-\\pi}{8}$ and then we divide by $4$ as that is the total amount of length (remember this is probability). Thus, we get $\\frac{26-\\pi}{32}$ for our probability, and so the answer is $26 + 1 + 32 = \\textbf{(A)}\\ 59$ . Some notes: I tried to explain everything but it's quite difficult to explain - there is a way of non-calculus (like there always is) that I think was mentioned above, something with circles (since the thing under the square root is just $x^2+y^2 = \\frac{1}{4}$ , so finding the average value of that isn't difficult). IronicNinja~ Edited by AngelaLZ~ Choose a certain side for one of the points to be on. Let the distance from the point to the vertex on its left be $x$  We split this into two cases: Case 1: $0\\leq x\\leq \\frac12$ : The total length of the segments for which the other point can be on such that the straight-line distance between the points is less than $\\frac12$ is \\[\\sqrt{\\frac14-x^2}+x+\\frac12.\\] We can graph this in the Cartesian plane and find the area of the region below the curve and above the line $y=0$ . Case 2: $\\frac12< x\\leq 1$ : This is basically Case 1 but flipped over the line $x=\\frac12$ . So our total probability is 1 minus the area of the graph over the total area (4, perimeter of square). Notice that the desired area of the region below the curve we found earlier is the sum of a quarter circle with radius $\\frac12$ and centered at $(0,0)$ and a trapezoid with height $\\frac12$ and bases of length $\\frac12$ and $\\frac32$ . Adding this all up then multiplying by 2, we have \\[\\frac{\\pi}{8}+\\frac34\\] and then the probability of the desired result would be \\[1-\\frac{\\pi+6}{32}=\\frac{26-\\pi}{32}\\] and our answer is $26+1+32=\\boxed{59}$ . ~caroline2023 Video Solution by Richard Rusczyk https://artofproblemsolving.com/videos/amc/2015amc12a/399  ~ dolphin7\n",

Thus for the expression to be a real number, either $\\cos(a\\pi)$ or $\\sin(b\\pi)$ must be $0$ , or the second term and the fourth term cancel each other out (because in the fourth term, you have $i^2 = -1$ ). $\\text{Case~1:}$ Either $\\cos(a\\pi)$ or $\\sin(b\\pi)$ is $0$ .

We also exclude values where the denominator is an odd number, for we cannot find any corresponding values(for example, if $a$ is $\\tfrac{1}{5}$ , then $b$ must be $\\tfrac{3}{10}$ , which we don't have).

      " Let us start with the two circles in $L_0$ and the circle in $L_1$ . Let the larger circle in $L_0$ be named circle $X$ with radius $x$ and the smaller be named circle $Y$ with radius $y$ . Also let the single circle in $L_1$ be named circle $Z$ with radius $z$ . Draw radii $x$ , $y$ , and $z$ perpendicular to the x-axis. Drop altitudes $a$ and $b$ from the center of $Z$ to these radii $x$ and $y$ , respectively, and drop altitude $c$ from the center of $Y$ to radius $x$ perpendicular to the x-axis. Connect the centers of circles $x$ , $y$ , and $z$ with their radii, and utilize the Pythagorean Theorem. We attain the following equations. \\[(x - z)^2 + a^2 = (x + z)^2 \\implies a^2 = 4xz\\]  \\[(y - z)^2 + b^2 = (y + z)^2 \\implies b^2 = 4yz\\]  \\[(x - y)^2 + c^2 = (x + y)^2 \\implies c^2 = 4xy\\]  We see that $a = 2\\sqrt{xz}$ , $b = 2\\sqrt{yz}$ , and $c = 2\\sqrt{xy}$ . Since $a + b = c$ , we have that $2\\sqrt{xz} + 2\\sqrt{yz} = 2\\sqrt{xy}$ . Divide this equation by $2\\sqrt{xyz}$ , and this equation becomes the well-known relation of Descartes's Circle Theorem $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{x}} + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{y}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{z}}.$ We can apply this relationship recursively with the circles in layers $L_2, L_3, \\cdots, L_6$ . Here, let $S(n)$ denote the sum of the reciprocals of the square roots of all circles in layer $n$ . The notation in the problem asks us to find the sum of the reciprocals of the square roots of the radii in each circle in this collection, which is $\\textstyle\\sum_{n=0}^{6}S(n)$ .  We already have that $S(0) = S(1) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{z}} = \\frac{1}{73} +  \\frac{1}{70}$ . Then, $S(2) = 2S(1) + S(0) = 3S(0)$ . Additionally, $S(3) = 2S(2) + 2S(1) + S(0) = 9S(0)$ , and $S(4) = 2S(3) + 2S(2) + 2S(1) + S(0) = 27S(0)$ . Now, we notice that $S(n + 1) = 3S(n)$ because $S(n + 1) = 2S(n) + 2S(n - 1) + \\cdots + 2S(1) + S(0)$ , which is a power of $3.$ Hence, our desired sum is $(1 + 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 + 81 + 243)(S(0)) = 365\\left(\\frac{1}{73} +  \\frac{1}{70}\\right)$ . This simplifies to $365\\left(\\frac{143}{73(70)}\\right) = \\frac{143}{14} \\textbf{(D)}$ . Note that the circles in this question are known as Ford circles. Let the two circles from $L_0$ be of radius $r_1$ and $r_2$ , with $r_1>r_2$ . Let the circle of radius $r_1$ be circle $A$ and the circle of radius $r_2$ be circle $B$ . Now, let the circle of $L_1$ have radius $r_3$ . Let this circle be circle $C$ . Draw the radii of the three circles down to the common tangential line and connect the radii. Draw two lines parallel to the common tangential line of the two layers intersecting the center point of circle $B$ and the center point of circle $C$ . Now, we have $3$ right triangles with a line of common length (The two parallel lines). Using the pythagorean theorem, we get the formula $\\sqrt{(r_2+r_1)^2-(r_2-r_1)^2}=\\sqrt{(r_1+r_3)^2-(r_1-r_3)^2}+\\sqrt{(r_2+r_3)^2-(r_2-r_3)^2}$ Now we solve for $r_3$ . Square both sides, use the identity $(a^2-b^2)=(a+b)(a-b)$ and simplify: $(2r_2)(2r_1) = (2r_1)(2r_3)+2\\sqrt{16r_1r_3r_2r_3}+(2r_2)(2r_3)=4(r_1r_3+r_2r_3+2r_3\\sqrt{r_1r_2})=4r_3(r_1+r_2+2\\sqrt{r_1r_2}) \\\\ 4r_2r_1=4r_3(r_1+r_2+2\\sqrt{r_1r_2}) \\implies r_3=\\frac{r_2r_1}{r_1+r_2+2\\sqrt{r_1r_2}}$  Now, let's change this into a function to clean things up: $f(x,y) = \\frac{xy}{x+y+2\\sqrt{xy}}=\\frac{xy}{(\\sqrt{x}+\\sqrt{y})^2}$ Let's begin to rewrite the sum we want to find in terms of the radii of the circles, call this $g(x)$ : $g(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{r}}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\frac{xy}{(\\sqrt{x}+\\sqrt{y})^2}}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{x}+\\sqrt{y}}{\\sqrt{xy}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{y}}{y}+\\frac{\\sqrt{x}}{x} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{y}}+\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{x}}$ Using this, we can find the sum of some layers: $L_0$ , $\\frac{1}{70}+\\frac{1}{73}$ , $L_0$ and $L_1$ : $\\frac{1}{70}+\\frac{1}{73}+\\frac{1}{70}+\\frac{1}{73} = 2(\\frac{1}{70}+\\frac{1}{73})$ This is interesting, we have that the sum of Layer 0 and Layer 1 is equal to twice of Layer 0. If we continue and find the sum of layers 0, 1 and 2, we see it is equal to $5(L_0)$ . This is getting very interesting, there must be some pattern. First of all, we should observe that finding $g(x)$ of a circle is equivalent to adding up those of the 2 larger circles to construct the smaller one. Second, upon further observation, we can draw out the layers. When we're finding the next layer, we can split the current layers across the center, so that each half includes the center circle $L_1$ . Now, if we were to find $g(x)$ , we notice we are doubling the current sum and including the center circle twice. So, the recursive sum would be $a_n=3a_{n-1}-1$ . So, applying this new formula, we get $\\sum_{C \\in S}\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{r}} = (3(3(3(3(3(3-1)-1)-1)-1)-1)-1)(\\frac{1}{70}+\\frac{1}{73})=365\\cdot(\\frac{1}{70}+\\frac{1}{73})=365\\cdot\\frac{143}{70\\cdot73}=\\boxed{\\frac{143}{14}}$  Video Solution by Richard Rusczyk https://artofproblemsolving.com/videos/amc/2015amc12a/402  ~ dolfin 7\n",

We know that in Mathematics and Science we have a total point score of 8 (since she will get As in both), so we only need a sum of 6 in English and History.

      " This problem becomes simple once we recognize that the domain of the function is $\\{4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, \\dots\\}$ . By evaluating $r(4)$ to be $4$ , we can see that $\\textbf{(E)}$ is incorrect. Evaluating $r(6)$ to be $5$ , we see that both $\\textbf{(B)}$ and $\\textbf{(C)}$ are incorrect. Since our domain consists of composite numbers, which, by definition, are a product of at least two positive primes, the minimum value of $r(n)$ is $4$ , so $\\textbf{(A)}$ is incorrect. That leaves us with $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D)}\\; \\text{the set of integers greater than }3}$ . Think backwards. The range is the same as the numbers $y$ that can be expressed as the sum of two or more prime positive integers. The lowest number we can get is $y = 2+2 = 4$ . For any number greater than 4, we can get to it by adding some amount of 2's and then possibly a 3 if that number is odd. For example, 23 can be obtained by adding 2 ten times and adding a 3; this corresponds to the argument $n = 2^{10} \\times 3$ .  Thus our answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D)}\\; \\text{the set of integers greater than }3}$ . Notice that by the Chicken McNugget Theorem, given $2$ s and $3$ s, we can make any number larger than $2\\cdot3 - 2 - 3 = 1.$ We also exclude $2$ and $3$ since they correspond to primes. All other numbers can be written as $2a + 3b,$ which $r(2^a3^b)$ will equal. Thus the answer is $D.$  Note that $r(10)$ eliminates $B$ and $C$ and $r(4)$ eliminates $E$ . We can easily see that $r(n)$ cannot be less that $3$ by testing $2$ and $3$ . So, the answer is clearly $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D)}\\; \\text{the set of integers greater than }3}$ .\n",

We can find the center by drawing the perpendicular bisectors of $WZ$ and $XY$ and finding their intersection point. This point happens to be the midpoint of $AB$ , the hypotenuse. Let this point be $M$ . To find the radius, determine $MY$ , where $MY^{2} = MA^2 + AY^2$ , $MA = \\frac{12}{2} = 6$ , and $AY = AB = 12$ . Thus, the radius $=r =MY = 6\\sqrt5$ . Next we let $AC = b$ and $BC = a$ . Consider the right triangle $ACB$ first. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we find that $a^2 + b^2 = 12^2 = 144$ . [asy] pair A,B,C,M,E,W,Z,X,Y; A=(2,0); B=(0,2); C=(0,0); M=(A+B)/2; W=(-2,2); Z=(-2,-0); X=(2,4); Y=(4,2); E=(W+Z)/2; draw(A--B--C--cycle); draw(W--B--C--Z--cycle); draw(A--B--X--Y--cycle); dot(M); dot(E); label(\"W\",W,NW); label(\"Z\",Z,SW); label(\"C\",C,S); label(\"A\",A,S); label(\"B\",B,N); label(\"X\",X,NE); label(\"Y\",Y,SE); label(\"E\",E,1.5*plain.W); label(\"M\",M,NE); draw(circle(M,sqrt(10))); draw(E--Z--M--cycle,dashed); [/asy] Now, we let $E$ be the midpoint of $WZ$ , and we consider right triangle $ZEM$ . By the Pythagorean theorem, we have that $\\left(\\frac{a}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(a + \\frac{b}{2}\\right)^2 = r^2 = 180$ . Expanding this equation, we get that \\[\\frac{1}{4}(a^2+b^2) + a^2 + ab = 180\\]  \\[\\frac{144}{4} + a^2 + ab = 180\\]  \\[a^2 + ab = 144 = a^2 + b^2\\]  \\[ab = b^2\\]  \\[b = a\\]  This means that $ABC$ is a 45-45-90 triangle, so $a = b = \\frac{12}{\\sqrt2} = 6\\sqrt2$ . Thus the perimeter is $a + b + AB = 12\\sqrt2 + 12$ which is answer $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C)}\\; 12 + 12\\sqrt2}$ . The center of the circle on which $X$ , $Y$ , $Z$ , and $W$ lie must be equidistant from each of these four points. Draw the perpendicular bisectors of $\\overline{XY}$ and of $\\overline{WZ}$ . Note that the perpendicular bisector of $\\overline{WZ}$ is parallel to $\\overline{CW}$ and passes through the midpoint of $\\overline{AC}$ . Therefore, the triangle that is formed by $A$ , the midpoint of $\\overline{AC}$ , and the point at which this perpendicular bisector intersects $\\overline{AB}$ must be similar to $\\triangle ABC$ , and the ratio of a side of the smaller triangle to a side of $\\triangle ABC$ is 1:2. Consequently, the perpendicular bisector of $\\overline{XY}$ passes through the midpoint of $\\overline{AB}$ . The perpendicular bisector of $\\overline{WZ}$ must include the midpoint of $\\overline{AB}$ as well. Since all points on a perpendicular bisector of any two points $M$ and $N$ are equidistant from $M$ and $N$ , the center of the circle must be the midpoint of $\\overline{AB}$ . Now the distance between the midpoint of $\\overline{AB}$ and $Z$ , which is equal to the radius of this circle, is $\\sqrt{12^2 + 6^2} = \\sqrt{180}$ . Let $a=AC$ . Then the distance between the midpoint of $\\overline{AB}$ and $Y$ , also equal to the radius of the circle, is given by $\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{a}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(a + \\frac{\\sqrt{144 - a^2}}{2}\\right)^2}$ (the ratio of the similar triangles is involved here). Squaring these two expressions for the radius and equating the results, we have \\[\\left(\\frac{a}{2}\\right)^2+\\left(a+\\frac{\\sqrt{144-a^2}}{2}\\right)^{2} = 180\\]  \\[144 - a^2 = a\\sqrt{144-a^2}\\]  \\[(144-a^2)^2 = a^2(144-a^2)\\]  Since $a$ cannot be equal to 12, the length of the hypotenuse of the right triangle, we can divide by $(144-a^2)$ , and arrive at $a = 6\\sqrt{2}$ . The length of other leg of the triangle must be $\\sqrt{144-72} = 6\\sqrt{2}$ . Thus, the perimeter of the triangle is $12+2(6\\sqrt{2}) = \\boxed{\\textbf{(C)}\\; 12+12\\sqrt{2}}$ . In order to solve this problem, we can search for similar triangles. Begin by drawing triangle $ABC$ and squares $ABXY$ and $ACWZ$ . Draw segments $\\overline{YZ}$ and $\\overline{WX}$ . Because we are given points $X$ , $Y$ , $Z$ , and $W$ lie on a circle, we can conclude that $WXYZ$ forms a cyclic quadrilateral. Take $\\overline{AC}$ and extend it through a point $P$ on $\\overline{YZ}$ . Now, we must do some angle chasing to prove that $\\triangle WBX$ is similar to $\\triangle YAZ$ . Let $\\alpha$ denote the measure of $\\angle ABC$ . Following this, $\\angle BAC$ measures $90 - \\alpha$ . By our construction, $\\overline{CAP}$ is a straight line, and we know $\\angle YAB$ is a right angle. Therefore, $\\angle PAY$ measures $\\alpha$ . Also, $\\angle CAZ$ is a right angle and thus, $\\angle ZAP$ is a right angle. Sum $\\angle ZAP$ and $\\angle PAY$ to find $\\angle ZAY$ , which measures $90 + \\alpha$ . We also know that $\\angle WBY$ measures $90 + \\alpha$ . Therefore, $\\angle ZAY = \\angle WBX$ . Let $\\beta$ denote the measure of $\\angle AZY$ . It follows that $\\angle WZY$ measures $90 + \\beta^\\circ$ . Because $WXYZ$ is a cyclic quadrilateral, $\\angle WZY + \\angle YXW = 180^\\circ$ . Therefore, $\\angle YXW$ must measure $90 - \\beta$ , and $\\angle BXW$ must measure $\\beta$ . Therefore, $\\angle AZY = \\angle BXW$ . $\\angle ZAY = \\angle WBX$ and $\\angle AZY = \\angle BXW$ , so $\\triangle AZY \\sim \\triangle BXW$ ! Let $x = AC = WC$ . By Pythagorean theorem, $BC = \\sqrt{144-x^2}$ . Now we have $WB = WC + BC = x + \\sqrt{144-x^2}$ , $BX = 12$ , $YA = 12$ , and $AZ = x$ . \n",
      "We can set up an equation: \\[\\frac{YA}{AZ} = \\frac{WB}{BX}\\]  \\[\\frac{12}{x} = \\frac{x+\\sqrt{144-x^2}}{12}\\]  \\[144 = x^2 + x\\sqrt{144-x^2}\\]  \\[12^2 - x^2 = x\\sqrt{144-x^2}\\]  \\[12^4 - 2*12^2*x^2 + x^4 = 144x^2 - x^4\\]  \\[2x^4 - 3(12^2)x^2 + 12^4 = 0\\]  \\[(2x^2 - 144)(x^2 - 144) = 0\\]  Solving for $x$ , we find that $x = 6\\sqrt{2}$ or $x = 12$ , which we omit. The perimeter of the triangle is $12 + x + \\sqrt{144-x^2}$ . Plugging in $x = 6\\sqrt{2}$ , we get $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C)}\\; 12+12\\sqrt{2}}$ . Alternatively, let $BC = S_1, AB = S_2$ and $AC = x$ . Because $\\frac{WB}{BX} = \\frac{AY}{AZ}$ , we get that $S_2^2 = S_1^2 + S_1x$ . $S_1 = x$ satisfies the equation because of Pythagorean theorem, so $\\triangle ABC$ is right isosceles. We claim that $X$ , $Y$ , $Z$ , and $W$ lie on a circle if $\\triangle ACB$ is an isosceles right triangle. Proof: If $\\triangle ACB$ is an isosceles right triangle, then $\\angle WAY=180º$ . Therefore, $W$ , $A$ , and $Y$ are collinear. Since $WY$ and $YX$ form a right angle, $WX$ is the diameter of the circumcircle of $\\triangle WYX$ . Similarly, $Z$ , $A$ , and $X$ are collinear, and $ZX$ forms a right angle with $ZW$ . Thus, $WX$ is also the diameter of the circumcircle of $\\triangle WZX$ . Therefore, since $\\triangle WYX$ and $\\triangle WZX$ share a circumcircle, $X$ , $Y$ , $Z$ , and $W$ lie on a circle if $\\triangle ACB$ is an isosceles triangle. If $\\triangle ACB$ is isosceles, then its legs have length $6\\sqrt{2}$ . The perimeter of $\\triangle ACB$ is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }12+12\\sqrt{2}}$ . Note that because $\\angle WZA=\\angle AYX=90^\\circ$ , these two angles inscribe the semicircle defined by diameter $WX$ . Since $A$ lies on line $ZA$ , and $\\angle XAY=45^\\circ$ (because $ABXY$ is a square), we can find that $\\angle ZAY= 180^\\circ - 45^\\circ = 135^\\circ$ . Now, we can see that $\\angle BAC=45^\\circ$ to complete the full $360^\\circ$ . Therefore, $\\triangle ABC$ is and isosceles right triangle, and $AC=BC=6\\sqrt2$ . So Our answer is $6\\sqrt2 + 6\\sqrt 2 + 12 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }12+12\\sqrt{2}}$ .\n",
      ". We see a circle and little information of position of the shapes inside the triangle, so we think of things associated with circles and think of cyclic quads. We then notice that quadrilateral $WXYZ$ is cyclic. Then we see that $\\angle W = \\angle X$ making extensions of $\\overline{WA}$ and $\\overline{XZ}$ diagonals of $WXYZ$ . Let $x = \\overline{AC}=\\overline{AW}$ . We can see that $\\overline{AY} = 12\\sqrt{2}$ and $\\overline{AZ} = x\\sqrt{2}$ . Thus $\\overline{YZ}^2 = x^2 + (x+12\\sqrt{2})^2 = 2x^2 + 24x\\sqrt{2} + 288$ . Let $\\angle ZAY = \\alpha$ . Then we can see that $\\angle ZAC$ and $\\angle BAY$ are $45$ degrees, making $\\angle ZAY$  $\\alpha + 90$ degrees. We can verify with the cosine addition identity that $-\\cos{\\alpha + 90 degree} = \\sin{\\alpha}$ (knowing that $\\sin{\\theta + 90 degree} = \\cos{\\theta}$ motivates this). By law of cosine's, $\\overline{YZ}^2 = (12\\sqrt{2})^2 + x\\sqrt{2})^2 - 2\\cdot 12\\sqrt{2} \\cdot x\\sqrt{2}cos{\\alpha + 90 degree} = 288 + x^2 + 48cos{\\alpha + 90 degree} = 288 + 2x^2 + 48x\\sin{\\alpha}$ . Since $\\angle{A}$ is opposite $\\overline{BC}$ , $\\sin{\\alpha} = \\frac{\\sqrt{144-x^2}}{12}$ . Thus $\\overline{YZ}^2 = 288 + 2x^2 + 4x\\sqrt{144-x^2}$ . Setting the first paragraph's $\\overline{YZ}^2$ equal to the second: \\[288 + x^2 + 4x\\sqrt{144-x^2}2x^2 + 24x\\sqrt{2} + 288\\] \n",

We will prove this by induction on $i$ and $j$ .  The base cases for $i = 5$ , have already been proven. For our inductive step, we must show that for all valid values of $j$ , $f(i, j) = 1$ if for all valid values of $j$ , $f(i - 1, j) = 1$ . We prove this itself by induction on $j$ .  For the base case, $j=0$ , $f(i, 0) = f(i-1, 1) = 1$ .  For the inductive step, we need $f(i, j) = 1$ if $f(i, j-1) = 1$ .  Then, $f(i, j) = f(i-1, f(i, j-1)).$  $f(i, j-1) = 1$ by our inductive hypothesis from our inner induction and $f(i-1, 1) = 1$ from our outer inductive hypothesis.  Thus, $f(i, j) = 1$ , completing the proof. It is now clear that for $i \\ge 5$ , $f(i,j) = 1$ for all values $0 \\le j \\le 4$ . Thus, $f(2015,2) = \\boxed{\\textbf{(B)} \\; 1}$ . We are given that \\[f(0,n) \\equiv n+1\\pmod{5} .\\] Then, $f(1,n) = f(0, f(1, n-1)) \\equiv f(1,n-1) + 1\\pmod{5}$ . Thus $f(1,n) \\equiv n+f(1,0)\\pmod{5}$ . Since $f(1,0)=f(0,1)=2$ , we get \\[f(1,n) \\equiv n+2\\pmod{5} .\\] Then, $f(2,n) = f(1, f(2, n-1)) \\equiv f(2,n-1) + 2\\pmod{5}$ . Thus $f(2,n) \\equiv 2n+f(2,0)\\pmod{5}$ . Since $f(2,0)=f(1,1)=3$ , we get \\[f(2,n) \\equiv 2n+3\\pmod{5} .\\] Now $f(3,n) = f(2, f(3, n-1)) \\equiv 2f(3,n-1) + 3\\pmod{5}$ . Thus \\begin{align*}     f(3,n) &\\equiv 2f(3,n-1) + 3 &\\pmod{5} \\\\     2f(3,n-1) &\\equiv 2^2f(3,n-2) + 3\\cdot 2 &\\pmod{5} \\\\     \\vdots \\qquad &\\quad\\vdots \\quad\\qquad \\vdots \\qquad\\qquad \\vdots &\\\\     2^{n-1}f(3,1) &\\equiv 2^nf(3,0) + 3\\cdot 2^{n-1} &\\pmod{5}  \\end{align*} Adding them all up we get \\[f(3,n) \\equiv 3(2^n-1)\\pmod{5} .\\] This means that $f(3,0)=0$ , $f(3,1)=3$ , $f(3,2)=4$ , $f(3,3)=1$ , and $f(3,4)=0$ . Thus $f(3,n)$ never takes the value 2. Since $f(4,n)=f(3,f(4,n-1))$ , this implies that $f(4,n) \\neq 2$ for any $n$ . By induction, $f(3,n) \\neq f(3,2) = 4$ for any $n$ . It follows that $f(3,n) \\neq f(3,4) = 0$ for any $n$ . Thus $f(4,n)$ only takes values in $\\{1,3\\}$ . In fact, it alternates between 1 and 3: $f(4,0)=f(3,1)=3$ , then $f(4,1)=f(3,f(4,0))=f(3,3)=1$ , then $f(4,2)=f(3,f(4,1))=f(3,1)=3$ , and so on. Repeating the argument above, we see that $f(5,n) = f(4, f(5,n-1))$ can only take values in $\\{1,3\\}$ . However, $f(5,n-1)\\neq 0$ for any $n$ implies that $f(5,n)\\neq f(4,0)=3$ for any $n$ . Thus $f(5,n)=1$ for all $n$ . We can easily verify this: $f(5,0)=f(4,1)=1$ , then $f(5,1)=f(4,f(5,0))=f(4,1)=1$ , then $f(5,2)=f(4,f(5,1))=f(4,1)=1$ , and so on. Then $f(6,0)=f(5,1)=1$ . Moreover, $f(6,n) = f(5,f(6,n-1)) = 1$ for all $n$ . Continuing in this manner we see that $f(m,n)=1$ for all $m\\ge 5$ . In particular, $f(2015,2) = \\boxed{\\textbf{(B)} \\; 1}$ .\n",

      " We can translate this wordy problem into this simple equation: \\[\\left\\lceil \\frac{s}{2} \\right\\rceil - 19 = \\left\\lceil \\frac{s}{5} \\right\\rceil\\]  We will proceed to solve this equation via casework. Case 1: $\\left\\lceil \\frac{s}{2} \\right\\rceil = \\frac{s}{2}$  Our equation becomes $\\frac{s}{2} - 19 = \\frac{s}{5} + \\frac{j}{5}$ , where $j \\in \\{0,1,2,3,4\\}$ Using the fact that $s$ is an integer, we quickly find that $j=1$ and $j=4$ yield $s=64$ and $s=66$ , respectively.  Case 2: $\\left\\lceil \\frac{s}{2} \\right\\rceil = \\frac{s}{2}+\\frac{1}{2}$  Our equation becomes $\\frac{s}{2} +\\frac{1}{2} - 19 = \\frac{s}{5} + \\frac{j}{5}$ , where $j \\in \\{0,1,2,3,4\\}$ Using the fact that $s$ is an integer, we quickly find that $j=2$ yields $s=63$ . Summing up we get $63+64+66=193$ . The sum of the digits is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D)}\\; 13}$ . It can easily be seen that the problem can be expressed by the equation: \\[\\left\\lceil \\frac{s}{2} \\right\\rceil - \\left\\lceil \\frac{s}{5} \\right\\rceil = 19\\]  However, because the ceiling function is difficult to work with, we can rewrite the previous equation as: \\[\\frac{s+a}{2} - \\frac{s+b}{5} = 19\\] Where $a \\in \\{0,1\\}$ and $b \\in \\{0,1,2,3,4\\}$ Multiplying both sides by ten and simplifying, we get: \\[5s+5a-2s-2b=190\\]  \\[3s = 190+2b-5a\\]  \\[s = 63 + \\frac{1+2b-5a}{3}\\]  Because s must be an integer, we need to find the values of $a$ and $b$ such that $2b-5a \\equiv 2 \\mod 3$ . We solve using casework. Case 1: $a = 0$  If $a = 0$ , we have $2b \\equiv 2 \\mod 3$ . We can easily see that $b = 1$ or $b = 4$ , which when plugged into our original equation lead to $s = 64$ and $s=66$ respectively.  Case 2: $a = 1$  If $a = 1$ , we have $2b-5 \\equiv 2 \\mod 3$ , which can be rewritten as $2b \\equiv 1 \\mod 3$ . We can again easily see that $b = 2$ is the only solution, which when plugged into our original equation lead to $s = 63$ . Adding these together we get $64+66+63=193$ . The sum of the digits is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D)}\\; 13}$ . As before, we write the equation: \\[\\left\\lceil \\frac{s}{2} \\right\\rceil - 19 = \\left\\lceil \\frac{s}{5} \\right\\rceil.\\]  To get a ballpark estimate of where $s$ might lie, we remove the ceiling functions to find: \\[\\frac{s}{2} - 19 = \\frac{s}{5}.\\]  This gives $\\frac{3s}{10} = 19$ , and thus values for $s$ will be around $\\frac{190}{3} = 63.\\overline3$ . Now, to establish some bounds around this estimated working value, we note that if $s=60$ , Cozy takes 30 steps while Dash takes 12, a difference of 18.  If $s=70$ , Cozy takes 35 steps while Dash takes 14, a difference of 21.  When $s$ increases from a multiple of ten, the difference will never decrease beyond what it is at the multiple of ten, and likewise, when it decreases, it never becomes greater than at the multiple of ten, so any working values of $s$ will be between $60$ and $70$ . Then, by inspection, $s=63, 64,$ or $66$ , so $\\sum s = 193 \\implies \\boxed{\\textbf{(D)}\\; 13}.$  Notice that the possible number of steps in the staircase is around 60 to 70. By testing all of the values between 60 and 70, we see that 63, 64 and 66 work. Adding those up gives 193, so the answer is $1+9+3=\\boxed{\\textbf{(D)}\\; 13}.$  We represent C's steps with $2c + a = n$ and D's steps with $5d + b = n$ , where $a \\in \\{1,2\\}$ and $b \\in \\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$ , where $n$ is the number of steps, $c$ is the number of jumps C takes bar the last one, and $d$ is the number of jumps D takes bar the last.\n",
      "The reason for starting at 1 and ending at 5 instead of 0 through 4 is that the last step can be quite problematic to deal with, especially if it is possible to make it in one go, so we treat it as a different jump that can take all possible jump values. We know that D makes it in 19 fewer than C, so $c+1-(d+1) = 19 \\implies c = 19+d \\implies 5d + b = 2(19+d) + a \\implies 3d = 38 + a - b$ . Now that we have this nice equivalence, we can do the thing and it works. If we take both sides mod 3 and rearrange, we get $b \\equiv 2+a \\pmod{3}$ This gives us the following satisfactory $(a,b)$ relational pairs: $\\{(1,3),(2,1),(2,4)\\}$ . We can now just find the corresponding $d$ value for each pair, sum it all up using $5d + b = n$ and sum the digits to reveal $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D)}\\; 13}$ as the answer. ~ $\\color{magenta} zoomanTV$  https://youtu.be/TpHZVbBGmVQ  ~IceMatrix\n",

      " Consider shifting every person over three seats left after each person has gotten up and sat back down again. Now, instead of each person being seated not in the same chair and not in an adjacent chair, each person will be seated either in the same chair or an adjacent chair. The problem now becomes the number of ways in which six people can sit down in a chair that is either the same chair or an adjacent chair in a circle. Consider the similar problem of $n$ people sitting in a chair that is either the same chair or an adjacent chair in a row. Call the number of possibilities for this $F_n$ . Then if the leftmost person stays put, the problem is reduced to a row of $n-1$ chairs, and if the leftmost person shifts one seat to the right, the new person sitting in the leftmost seat must be the person originally second from the left, reducing the problem to a row of $n-2$ chairs. Thus, $F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$ for $n \\geq 3$ . Clearly $F_1 = 1$ and $F_2 = 2$ , so $F_3 = 3$ , $F_4 = 5$ , and $F_5 = 8$ . Now consider the six people in a circle and focus on one person. If that person stays put, the problem is reduced to a row of five chairs, for which there are $F_5 = 8$ possibilities. If that person moves one seat to the left, then the person who replaces him in his original seat will either be the person originally to the right of him, which will force everyone to simply shift over one seat to the left, or the person originally to the left of him, which reduces the problem to a row of four chairs, for which there are $F_4 = 5$ possibilities, giving $1 + 5 = 6$ possibilities in all. By symmetry, if that person moves one seat to the right, there are another $6$ possibilities, so we have a total of $8+6+6 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(D)}\\; 20}$ possibilities. Label the people sitting at the table $A, B, C, D, E, F,$ and assume that they are initially seated in the order $ABCDEF$ . The possible new positions for $A, B, C, D, E,$ and $F$ are respectively (a dash indicates a non-allowed position): \\[\\begin{tabular}{| c | c | c | c | c | c |} \\hline - & - & A & A & A & - \\\\ \\hline - & - & - & B & B & B \\\\ \\hline C & - & - & - & C & C \\\\ \\hline D & D & - & - & - & D \\\\ \\hline E & E & E & - & - & - \\\\ \\hline - & F & F & F & - & - \\\\ \\hline \\end{tabular}\\]  The permutations we are looking for should use one letter from each column, and there should not be any repeated letters: $\\begin{tabular}{c} CDEFAB \\\\ CEAFBD \\\\ CEFABD \\\\ CEFBAD \\\\ CFEABD \\\\ CFEBAD \\\\ DEAFBC \\\\ DEAFCB \\\\ DEFABC \\\\ DEFACB \\\\ DEFBAC \\\\ DFEABC \\\\ DFEACB \\\\ DFEBAC \\\\ EDAFBC \\\\ EDAFCB \\\\ EDFABC \\\\ EDFACB \\\\ EDFBAC \\\\ EFABCD \\end{tabular}$  There are $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D)}\\; 20}$ such permutations. We can represent each rearrangement as a permutation of the six elements $\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}$ in cycle notation. Note that any such permutation cannot have a 1-cycle, so the only possible types of permutations are 2,2,2-cycles, 4,2-cycles, 3,3-cycles, and 6-cycles. We deal with each case separately. For 2,2,2-cycles, suppose that one of the 2-cycles switches the people across from each other, i.e. $(14)$ , $(25)$ , or $(36)$ . WLOG, we may assume it to be $(14)$ . Then we could either have both of the other 2-cycles be across from each other, giving the permutation $(14)(25)(36)$ or else neither of the other 2-cycles is across from each other, in which case the only possible permutation is $(14)(26)(35)$ . This can happen for $(25)$ and $(36)$ as well. So since the first permutation is not counted twice, we find a total of $1+3=4$ permutations that are 2,2,2-cycles where at least one of the 2-cycles switches people diametrically opposite from each other. Otherwise, since the elements in a 2-cycle cannot differ by 1, 3, or 5 mod 6, they must differ by 2 or 4 mod 6, i.e. they must be of the same parity. But since we have three odd and three even elements, this is impossible. Hence there are exactly 4 such permutations that are 2,2,2-cycles. For 4,2-cycles, we assume for the moment that 1 is part of the 2-cycle. Then the 2-cycle can be $(13)$ , $(15)$ , or $(14)$ . The first two are essentially the same by symmetry, and we must arrange the elements 2, 4, 5, 6 into a 4-cycle. However, 5 must have two neighbors that are not next to it, which is impossible, hence the first two cases yield no permutations. If the 2-cycle is $(14)$ , then we must arrange the elements 2, 3, 5, 6 into a 4-cycle. Then 2 must have the neighbors 5 and 6. We find that the 4-cycles $(2536)$ and $(2635)$ satisfy the desired properties, yielding the permutations $(14)(2536)$ and $(14)(2635)$ . This can be done for the 2-cycles $(25)$ and $(36)$ as well, so we find a total of 6 such permutations that are 4,2-cycles. For 3,3-cycles, note that if 1 neighbor 4, then the third element in the cycle will neighbor one of 1 and 4, so this is impossible. Therefore, the 3-cycle containing 1 must consist of elements 1, 3, and 5. Therefore, we obtain the four 3,3-cycles $(135)(246)$ , $(153)(246)$ , $(135)(264)$ , and $(153)(264)$ . For 6-cycles, note that the neighbors of 1 can be 3 and 4, 3 and 5, or 4 and 5. In the first case, we may assume that it looks like $(314\\dots)$ -- the form $(413\\dots)$ is also possible but equivalent to this case. Then we must place the elements 2, 5, and 6. Note that 5 and 6 cannot go together, so 2 must go in between them. Also, 5 cannot neighbor 4, so we are left with one possibility, namely $(314625)$ , which has an analogous possibility $(413526)$ . In the second case, we assume that it looks like $(315\\dots)$ . The 2 must go next to the 5, and the 6 must go last (to neighbor the 3), so the only possibility here is $(315246)$ , with the analogous possibility $(513642)$ . In the final case, we may assume that it looks like $(415\\dots)$ . Then the 2 and 3 cannot go together, so the 6 must go in between them. Therefore, the only possibility is $(415362)$ , with the analogous possibility $(514263)$ . We have covered all possibilities for 6-cycles, and we have found 6 of them. Therefore, there are $4+6+4+6 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(D)}\\; 20}$ such permutations. Notice the question is not any different than counting the cases if someone either stays put or moves one seat to the left or right (as in the above solution). WLOG, say the beginning case is ABCDEF (before any transformations). Thus, we can count these cases up: Case 1: Everyone stays put.\n",
      "Then, there is only one case (ABCDEF). Case 2: Everyone moves.\n",
      "Notice that if A moves to the right to B's seat, B has either two options. B can move to the left (to A's seat) or move to the right to C's seat. If B moves to C's seat, C cannot cancel the loop by going to A's seat, since we set the restriction as each person can only move ONE seat to the left/right. The only way to finish this process would be C moving to D, D moving to E, E moving to F, and F moving to A, achieving FABCDE as a case. Of course, A can move left and the same loop would occur but in the opposite direction (BCDEFA). Thus, we achieve two cases. Case 3: The movement of seats cancel out each other.\n",
      "If A moves to B's seat, B can move to A's seat, canceling the cycle. In this case, we would look to C, where this same thing could happen (note, however, that if C moves to D's seat, D cannot move to E's seat as the loop would be unachievable; furthermore, note that C cannot move to B's seat if A is already there since that would mean A would have to move to C's seat which is restricted). We can count these cases by grouping each pair and then doing subcases: Subcase 1: AB CD and EF are grouped.\n",
      "Here we have 2*2*2 = 8 cases, but they cannot all stay put since we've already counted that possibility in Case 1, and thus there are 7 cases here. Subcase 2: BC DE and FA are grouped.\n",
      "Here again, we have 2*2*2 = 8 cases, and then subtract the overcounted case to get 7 cases. Subcase 3: There is overlap so that two people do not change.\n",
      "If A and B change seats, D and E could change seats, and this would not have been counted by the previous groupings (since its an odd parity grouping + an even parity grouping). Count this simply by listing out the cases, or notice that this just means the two people sitting three seats away not moving. There are three cases of that happening (A and D not moving, B and E not moving, and C and F not moving). Look back at all our cases. Sum them up to get $1+2+7+7+3 = 20$  iron\n",

Before the casework, let's consider the possible range for $b$ if $\\frac{1}{b}+\\frac{1}{c}=k>0$ . From $\\frac{1}{b}<k$ , we have $b>\\frac{1}{k}$ .

      " First, note that $PQ$ lies on the radical axis of any of the pairs of circles. Suppose that $O_1$ and $O_2$ are the centers of two circles $C_1$ and $C_2$ that intersect exactly at $P$ and $Q$ , with $O_1$ and $O_2$ lying on the same side of $PQ$ , and $O_1 O_2=39$ . Let $x=O_1 R$ , $y=O_2 R$ , and suppose that the radius of circle $C_1$ is $r$ and the radius of circle $C_2$ is $\\tfrac{5}{8}r$ . Then the power of point $R$ with respect to $C_1$ is \\[(r+x)(r-x) = r^2 - x^2 = 24^2\\]  and the power of point $R$ with respect to $C_2$ is \\[\\left(\\frac{5}{8}r + y\\right) \\left(\\frac{5}{8}r - y\\right) = \\frac{25}{64}r^2 - y^2 = 24^2.\\]  Also, note that $x-y=39$ . Subtract the above two equations to find that $\\tfrac{39}{64}r^2 - x^2 + y^2 = 0$ or $39 r^2 = 64(x^2-y^2)$ . As $x-y=39$ , we find that $r^2=64(x+y) = 64(2y+39)$ . Plug this into an earlier equation to find that $25(2y+39)-y^2=24^2$ . This is a quadratic equation with solutions $y=\\tfrac{50 \\pm 64}{2}$ , and as $y$ is a length, it is positive, hence $y=57$ , and $x=y+39=96$ . This is the only possibility if the two centers lie on the same side of their radical axis. On the other hand, if they lie on opposite sides, then it is clear that there is only one possibility, and then it is clear that $O_1 R + O_2 R = O_1 O_2 = 39$ . Therefore, we obtain exactly four possible centers, and the sum of the desired lengths is $57+96+39 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(D)}\\; 192}$ . Note that if a circle passes through a pair of points, the center of the circle is on the perpendicular bisector of the line segment between the pair of points. This means that $A$ , $B$ , $C$ , and $D$ are all on the perpendicular bisector of $PQ$ . Let us say the distance from $A$ to the line $PQ$ is some $a$ . Therefore, the distance from $B$ to the line $PQ$ is $\\sqrt{(\\frac{8}{5}\\sqrt{a^2 + 24^2})^2 - 24^2}$ , which comes out to be $\\sqrt{\\frac{64}{25}a^2 + \\frac{39}{25}\\cdot 576}$ . Since $AB = 39$ , we have one of $\\sqrt{\\frac{64}{25}a^2 + \\frac{39}{25}\\cdot 576} \\pm a$ to be equal to $39$ . We can solve both equations to get that out of the four possible solutions, and only two are positive: $7$ and $57$ . Note that since no two circles can be congruent, we need the radius of one of $A$ or $C$ to be $7$ and the other to be $57$ . Plugging in to find the corresponding radii of $B$ and $D$ gives $32$ and $96$ , and adding everything up gives $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) }192}$ . ~hyxue Let's start by drawing $PQ$ . Because all circles contain $P$ and $Q$ , all the centers lie on the perpendicular bisector of $PQ$ , and point $R$ is on this bisector. For all the circle radii to be different (there can't be two congruent circles), two centers are on the same side of $PQ$ , and two are on the opposite side of $PQ$ . For the latter two circles--call them $A$ and $B$ -- $AR+BR=39$ . Let's consider the next case, where $C$ and $D$ lie on the same side. Construct right triangles from the picture, and use the Pythagorean Theorem (divide by 3 to negate big numbers). You will get that the distance from $R$ to the closest circle center is $57$ . Therefore, the answer is $39+2\\cdot57+39=\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) }192}$ . Since the radical axis $PQ$ is perpendicular to the line connecting the center of the circles, we have that $A$ , $B$ , $C$ , $D$ , and $R$ are collinear. WLOG, assume that $A$ and $B$ are on the same side of $R$ and let $AR=y$ and let $BP=x$ so that $AP=\\frac{5}{8}x$ . Then, using the Pythagorean Theorem on right triangles $PBR$ and $PAR$ , \\[(39+y)^2+24^2=x^2\\qquad(1)\\]  \\[y^2+24^2=\\frac{25}{64}x^2\\qquad(2)\\] Subtracting the $(2)$ from $(1)$ gives \\[x^2=64(2y+39)\\qquad(3)\\] Substituting $(3)$ into $(2)$ gives $y^2-50y-399=0=(y-57)(y+7).$ Taking the positive solution ( $y>0$ ), $y=AR=57$ and $BR=(57)+39=96$ . Since none of the circles are congruent, $C$ and $D$ must be on the opposite side of $R$ so $CR+DR=CD=39$ . Hence, $AR+BR+CR+DR=57+96+39=\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) }192}$ . Note that the four circles are coaxial, meaning $A,B,C,D,R$ are all collinear. Let $AR=x$ . By Pythagorean Theorem , the radius of circle $A$ squared would be $r_A^2 = x^2+24^2$ and the radius of circle $B$ squared would be $r_B^2 = (x+39)^2+24^2.$ Since $r_A^2 = \\dfrac{25}{64}r_B^2$ , \\[x^2+24^2 = \\dfrac{25}{64}((x+39)^2+24^2)\\] Solving this will give $x^2-50x-399 = 0$ , or $x=57, -7$ ; $AR = 57$ . The same equation will apply to $CR$ ; $CR$ would be the other root: $CR=7$ (the negative $7$ signals that $C$ is the negative, or opposite, direction of $D$ , about $R$ ). Thus, $AR = 57$ , $BR = 57+39 = 96$ , $CR = 7$ , $DR = 39-7 = 32$ , implying $AR+BR+CR+DR = \\boxed{\\textbf{(D) }192}$ . ~sml1809\n",

      " Let $x=e^{i\\pi/6}$ , a $30^\\circ$ counterclockwise rotation centered at the origin. Notice that $P_k$ on the complex plane is: \\[1+2x+3x^2+\\cdots+(k+1)x^k\\]  We need to find the magnitude of $P_{2015}$ on the complex plane. This is an arithmetico-geometric series . \\begin{align*} S &=1+2x+3x^2+\\cdots+2015x^{2014} \\\\ xS &=x+2x^2+3x^3+\\cdots+2015x^{2015} \\\\ (1-x)S &=1+x+x^2+\\cdots+x^{2014}-2015x^{2015} \\\\ S &= \\frac{1-x^{2015}}{(1-x)^2}-\\frac{2015x^{2015}}{1-x} \\end{align*}  We want to find $|S|$ . First, note that $x^{2015}=x^{11}=x^{-1}$ because $x^{12}=1$ . Therefore \\[S =\\frac{1-\\frac{1}{x}}{(1-x)^2}-\\frac{2015}{x(1-x)}=-\\frac{1}{x(1-x)}-\\frac{2015}{x(1-x)}=-\\frac{2016}{x(1-x)}.\\]  Hence, since $|x|=1$ , we have $|S| = \\frac{2016}{|1-x|}.$  Now we just have to find $|1-x|$ . This can just be computed directly: \\[1-x=1-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}-\\frac{1}{2}i\\]  \\[|1-x|^2=\\left(1-\\sqrt{3}+\\frac{3}{4}\\right)+\\frac{1}{4}=2-\\sqrt{3}={\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{6}-\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right)}^2\\]  \\[|1-x|=\\frac{\\sqrt{6}-\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\]  Therefore $|S|=2016\\cdot\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{6}-\\sqrt{2}}=2016\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{6}+\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right)=1008\\sqrt{2}+1008 \\sqrt{6}$ . Thus the answer is $1008+2+1008+6=\\boxed{\\textbf{(B)}\\; 2024}$ . Here is an alternate solution that does not use complex numbers: The distance from $P_{2015}$ to $P_0$ can be evaluated using the Pythagorean theorem . Assuming $P_0$ lies at the origin, we can calculate the distance the bee traveled to $P_{2015}$ by evaluating the distance the bee traveled in the x-direction and the y-direction. Let's start by summing each movement: $x=1\\cos{0}+2\\cos{30}+3\\cos{60}+\\cdots+2014\\cos{270}+2015\\cos{300}$  A movement of $p$ units at $q$ degrees is the same thing as a movement of $-p$ units at $q-180$ degrees, so we can adjust all the cosines with arguments greater than $180$ as follows: $x=1\\cos{0}+2\\cos{30}+3\\cos{60}+4\\cos{90}+5\\cos{120}+6\\cos{150}-7\\cos{0}-8\\cos{30}-\\cdots-2015\\cos{120}$  Grouping terms with like-cosines and factoring out the cosines: $x=(1-7+13-\\cdots+2005-2011)\\cos{0}+\\cdots+(6-12+18-\\cdots-2004+2010)\\cos{150}$  Each sum in the parentheses has $336$ terms (except the very last one, which has $335$ ). By pairing each term, we see there are $\\frac{336}{2}$ pairs of $-6$ . Therefore, each sum equals $168\\cdot-6=-1008$ except the very last sum, which has $167$ pairs of $-6$ plus an extra 2010 and equals $167\\cdot-6+2010=1008$ . Plugging in these values: $x=-1008\\cos{0}-1008\\cos{30}-1008\\cos{60}-1008\\cos{90}-1008\\cos{120}+1008\\cos{150}$  $x=1008(-1-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}-\\frac{1}{2}-0+\\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})=-1008(1+\\sqrt{3})$  We can find how far the bee traveled in the y-direction using the same logic as above, we arrive at the sum: $y=-1008\\sin{0}-1008\\sin{30}-1008\\sin{60}-1008\\sin{90}-1008\\sin{120}+1008\\sin{150}$  $y=1008(0-\\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}-1-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}+\\frac{1}{2})=-1008(1+\\sqrt{3})$  Finally, we use the Pythagorean to find the distance from $P_0$ . This distance is given by: $\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}=\\sqrt{(-1008(1+\\sqrt{3}))^2+(-1008(1+\\sqrt{3}))^2}=\\sqrt{2\\cdot1008^2\\cdot(1+\\sqrt{3})^2}=1008(1+\\sqrt{3})\\sqrt{2}=1008\\sqrt{2}+1008\\sqrt{6}$ , so the answer is $1008+2+1008+6=\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }2024}$ . We first notice that if the bee is turning 30 degrees each turn, it will take 12 turns to be looking in the same direction when the bee initially left. This means we simply need to answer the question; how far will the bee be when the bee is facing in the same direction? First we use the fact that after 3 turns, the bee will be facing in a direction perpendicular to the the initial direction. From here we can draw a perpendicular from $P_2$ to the line $\\overline{P_0P_1}$ intersecting a point $C_0$ . We will also place the point $C_1$ at the intersection of $\\overline{P_0P_1}$ and $\\overline{P_3P_4}$ . In addition, the point $C_2$ is placed at the perpendicular dropped from $P_2$ to the line $\\overline{P_3C_1}$ . We will also set the distance $\\overline{P_0P_1} = n$ and thus $\\overline{P_1P_2} = n+1$ . With this perpendicular we see that the triangle $\\triangle{P_1P_2C_0}$ is a 30-60-90 triangle. This means that the length $\\overline{P_1C_0} = \\frac{(n+1)\\sqrt{3}}{2}$ and the length $\\overline{C_1C_2} = \\frac{n+1}{2}$ . We can also see that the triangle $\\triangle{P_2C_1P_3}$ is a 30-60-90 triangle and thus $\\overline{C_0C_1} = \\frac{n+2}{2}$ and $\\overline{C_2P_3} = \\frac{(n+2)\\sqrt{3}}{2}$ . Now if we continue this across all $P_i$ and set the point $P_0$ to the coordinates $(0, 0)$ . As you can see, we are inherently putting a “box” around the figure. Doing similar calculations for all four “sides” of this spiral we get that the length \\[\\overline{P_0C_1} = n + \\frac{(n+1)\\sqrt{3}}{2} + \\frac{n+2}{2}\\] , \\[\\overline{C_1C_4} = \\frac{(n+1)}{2} + \\frac{(n+2)\\sqrt{3}}{2} + (n+3) + \\frac{(n+4)\\sqrt{3}}{2} + \\frac{n+5}{2}\\] , \\[\\overline{C_4C_7} = \\frac{(n+4)}{2} + \\frac{(n+5)\\sqrt{3}}{2} + (n+6) + \\frac{(n+7)\\sqrt{3}}{2} + \\frac{n+8}{2}\\] , \\[\\overline{C_7C_{10}} = \\frac{(n+7)}{2} + \\frac{(n+8)\\sqrt{3}}{2} + (n+9) + \\frac{(n+10)\\sqrt{3}}{2} + \\frac{n+11}{2}\\] , and finally \\[\\overline{C_{10}P_{12}} = \\frac{(n+10)}{2} + \\frac{(n+11)\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\] . Here the point $C_4$ is defined as the intersection of lines $\\overline{P_3P_4}$ and $\\overline{P_6P_7}$ . The point $C_7$ is defined as the intersection of lines $\\overline{P_6P_7}$ and $\\overline{P_9P_{10}}$ . Finally, the point $C_10$ is defined as the intersection of lines $\\overline{P_{9}P_{10}}$ and $\\overline{P_{12}P_{13}}$ . Note that our spiral stops at $P_{12}$ before the next spiral starts. Calculating the offset from the x and the y direction, we see that the offset, or the new point $P_{12}$ , is $({-6}, {-6}-12 \\sqrt{3})$ . This is an interesting property that the points’ coordinate changes by a constant offset no matter what $n$ is. Since the new point’s subscript changes by 12 each time and we see that 2016 is divisible by 12, the point $P_{2016} = ({-168} \\cdot {6}, {168} \\cdot ({-6} \\sqrt{3} {-12}))$ . Using similar 30-60-90 triangle properties, we see that $P_{2015} = ({-6} \\cdot 168-1008 \\sqrt{3}, 168({-6} \\sqrt{3} - 12) + 1008)$ . Using the distance formula, the numbers cancel out nicely (1008 is divisible by 168, so take 168 when using the distance formula) and we see that the final answer is $(1008)(1+\\sqrt{3})(\\sqrt{2})$ which gives us a final answer of $\\boxed{2024}$ . -bowmanrocks32  Suppose that the bee makes a move of distance $i$ . After $6$ turns it will be facing the opposite direction and move $i+6$ units. Combining these opposite movements gives a total movement of $-6$ units in the original direction. This means that every $12$ moves, the bee will move $-6$ units in each direction of $0^\\circ, 30^\\circ, 60^\\circ, 90^\\circ, 120^\\circ, 150^\\circ$ . We want to find the displacement vector for every $12$ moves. Factoring out the $-6$ for now (which flips the direction), we draw a quick diagram of one unit in each direction. [asy] draw((0,0)--(1,0)--(1+sqrt(3)/2, 1/2)--(3/2+sqrt(3)/2, 1/2+sqrt(3)/2)--(3/2+sqrt(3)/2, 3/2+sqrt(3)/2)--(1+sqrt(3)/2, 3/2+sqrt(3))--(1, 2+sqrt(3)), EndArrow); draw((1,0)--(3/2+sqrt(3)/2, 0), dashed); draw((1,2+sqrt(3))--(3/2+sqrt(3)/2, 2+sqrt(3)), dashed); draw((3/2+sqrt(3)/2, 2+sqrt(3))--(3/2+sqrt(3)/2, 0), dashed); draw((1+sqrt(3)/2,0)--(1+sqrt(3)/2, 1/2)--(3/2+sqrt(3)/2, 1/2), dashed); draw((1+sqrt(3)/2,2+sqrt(3))--(1+sqrt(3)/2, 3/2+sqrt(3))--(3/2+sqrt(3)/2, 3/2+sqrt(3)), dashed); [/asy] Using the 30-60-90 triangles, it is clear that the displacement vector (factoring back in the $-6$ ) is $-6\\left\\langle 1, 2+\\sqrt{3}\\right\\rangle$ . To compute the distance to $P_{2015}$ , we can compute the position of $P_{2016}$ (a multiple of $12$ moves) and then subtract the vector from $P_{2015}$ to $P_{2016}$ . The bee reaches $P_{2016}$ after $\\frac{2016}{12} = 168$ sets of $12$ moves, so the total displacement vector to $P_{2016}$ is $168(-6)\\left\\langle 1, 2+\\sqrt{3}\\right\\rangle = \\left\\langle -1008, -2006-1008\\sqrt{3}\\right\\rangle$ . The bee moves at an angle of $-30^\\circ$ from $P_{2015}$ to $P_{2016}$ , so subtracting it means moving an angle of $150^\\circ$ . Since the vector is $2016$ units long, by a 30-60-90 triangle, it is $\\left\\langle -1008\\sqrt{3}, 1008\\right\\rangle$ . Therefore the total displacement vector to $P_{2015}$ is $\\left\\langle -1008, -2006-1008\\sqrt{3}\\right\\rangle + \\left\\langle -1008\\sqrt{3}, 1008\\right\\rangle = \\left\\langle -1008-1008\\sqrt{3}, -1008-1008\\sqrt{3}\\right\\rangle$ . The displacement is thus $\\sqrt{2}\\left|-1008-1008\\sqrt{3}\\right| = 1008\\sqrt{2}+1008\\sqrt{6} \\implies 1008+2+1008+6 = \\boxed{\\text{(B) }2024}$ . Fun fact: The displacement to $P_{2016}$ is the same as for $P_{2015}$ . Let $P_0$ be the origin. East would be the real axis in the positive direction. Then we can assign each $P_n$ a complex value. The displacement would then be the magnitude of the complex number. Notice that after the $n$ th move the value of $P_n$ is $P_{n-1}+ne^{\\frac{i(n-1)\\pi}{6}}$ . Also notice that after six moves the bee is facing in the opposite direction. And because we have found a recursion, we can add these up. Then we have \\[P_n=e^{0}+2e^{\\frac{i\\pi}{6}}+\\cdots+2015e^{\\frac{2014i\\pi}{6}},\\] and this becomes \\[(1-7+13-\\cdots-2011)e^0+(2-8+\\cdots-2012)e^{\\frac{i\\pi}{6}}+\\cdots+(6-12+\\cdots+2010)e^{\\frac{5i\\pi}{6}}.\\]  Simplifying, we have \\[-6\\cdot168-6\\cdot168e^{\\frac{i\\pi}{6}}-6\\cdot168e^{\\frac{2i\\pi}{6}}-6\\cdot168e^{\\frac{3i\\pi}{6}}-6\\cdot168e^{\\frac{4i\\pi}{6}}-(2010-6\\cdot167)e^{\\frac{5i\\pi}{6}},\\] which eventually simplifies to \\[-1008-(2+\\sqrt3)1008i,\\] and this is a $15-75-90$ triangle which has ratios of $1:(2+\\sqrt3):(\\sqrt2+\\sqrt6)$ so the magnitude is $1008\\sqrt2+1008\\sqrt6$ and the answer is $1008+2+1008+6=\\boxed{\\text{(B) }2024}$ . ~caroline2023  After each 12 moves, the bee will be facing the same direction as it started. Let $P_0$ be the origin and let $P_n$ (with $n$ divisible by $12$ ) be $(x,y)$ . We now notice that each of the move pairs with lengths $n+1$ / $n+7$ , $n+2$ / $n+8$ , $n+3$ / $n+9$ , $n+4$ / $n+10$ , $n+5$ / $n+11$ , $n+6$ / $n+12$ will move the bee 6 units in the directions corresponding to the moves with lengths $n+7$ , $n+8$ , $n+9$ , $n+10$ , $n+11$ , and $n+12$ . This equates to moving the bee from $(x,y)$ to $(x-6,y-12-6\\sqrt{3})$ , a move that repeats every 12 moves. Since $\\frac{2016}{12} = 168$ , we have that $P_(2016) = (-1008, -2016-1008\\sqrt{3})$ . It follows that $P_(2015) = (-1008-1008\\sqrt{3}, -1008-1008\\sqrt{3})$ so the distance to $P_0$ is $1008(\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{6})$ so the answer is $1008 + 2 + 1008 + 6 = \\boxed{\\text{(B) } 2024}$ . - bobjoebilly\n",

Since the desired area is half the shaded region, our area is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D)}\\ 6\\frac{1}{2}}$ . ~Champion1234 Note that the area before and after the intersection is the same, so we can just consider the area before the intersection and double it to get the total area of the shaded region. There are two linear lines that can be labeled. The first intersects the side of length 5; By letting the bottom left side of the triangle be defined as (0,0), its slope is $m = \\frac{1-4}{8-0} = -\\frac{3}{8}$ . Therefore, $\\\\ y_1 = -\\frac{3}{8}x + b$  $\\\\ y_1(0) = b = 4$  $\\\\ y_1 = -\\frac{3}{8}x + 4$  The second line's equation can be found in a similar fashion.

One thing to note is that we have to start at the point (1,5) because the rest of $y_2$ is outside of the rectangle. The area of the remaining shaded part from [0,1) can also be found using an integral. Assume the top side of the rectangle is defined as y = 5. We can find the area between the lines by integrating the expression $5 - y_1$ . Now where do the lines meet? $\\\\ y_1 = y_2$  $\\\\ -\\frac{3}{8}x + 4 = -\\frac{5}{6}x + \\frac{35}{6}$ Solving for x yields 4, so the graphs intersect at x = 4.

Less than $\\frac{3}{5}$ of the green balls will be on the same side of the red ball if the red ball is inserted inside the middle block of $n$ balls, and there are $n - 1$ positions where this happens.

So, our answer is $3\\cdot 2=\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }6.}$  We know the sum of each face is $18.$ If we look at an edge of the cube whose numbers sum to $x$ , it must be possible to achieve the sum $18-x$ in two distinct ways, looking at the two faces which contain the edge. If $8$ and $6$ were on the same edge, it is possible to achieve the desired sum only with the numbers $1$ and $3$ since the values must be distinct. Similarly, if $8$ and $7$ were on the same edge, the only way to get the sum is with $1$ and $2$ . This means that $6$ and $7$ are not on the same edge as $8$ , or in other words they are diagonally across from it on the same face, or on the other end of the cube. Now we look at three cases, each yielding two solutions which are reflections of each other: 1) $6$ and $7$ are diagonally opposite $8$ on the same face. 2) $6$ is diagonally across the cube from $8$ , while $7$ is diagonally across from $8$ on the same face. 3) $7$ is diagonally across the cube from $8$ , while $6$ is diagonally across from $8$ on the same face.

We get \\[PR^2 = (\\sqrt{8} + \\sqrt{24})^2 + 4 = 36 + 16\\sqrt{3} \\Rightarrow PR = \\sqrt{36 + 16\\sqrt{3}} = 2\\sqrt{9 + 4\\sqrt{3}}\\]  To make our calculations easier, let $\\sqrt{9 + 4\\sqrt{3}} = a$ . The semi-perimeter of our triangle is $\\frac{3 + 5 + 2a}{2} = 4 + a$ . Symbolize the area of the triangle with $A$ .

      " Since the prime factorization of $110$ is $2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 11$ , we have that the number is equal to $2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 11 \\cdot n^3$ .  This has $2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2=8$ factors when $n=1$ .  This needs a multiple of 11 factors, which we can achieve by setting $n=2^3$ , so we have $2^{10} \\cdot 5 \\cdot 11$ has $44$ factors.  To achieve the desired $110$ factors, we need the number of factors to also be divisible by $5$ , so we can set $n=2^3 \\cdot 5$ , so $2^{10} \\cdot 5^4 \\cdot 11$ has $110$ factors.  Therefore, $n=2^3 \\cdot 5$ .  In order to find the number of factors of $81n^4$ , we raise this to the fourth power and multiply it by $81$ , and find the factors of that number.  We have $3^4 \\cdot 2^{12} \\cdot 5^4$ , and this has $5 \\cdot 13 \\cdot 5=\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) }325}$ factors. $110n^3$ clearly has at least three distinct prime factors, namely 2, 5, and 11. The number of factors of $p_1^{n_1}\\cdots p_k^{n_k}$ is $(n_1+1)\\cdots(n_k+1)$ when the $p$ 's are distinct primes. This tells us that none of these factors can be 1. The number of factors is given as 110. The only way to write 110 as a product of at least three factors without $1$ s is $2\\cdot 5\\cdot 11$ . We conclude that $110n^3$ has only the three prime factors 2, 5, and 11 and that the multiplicities are 1, 4, and 10 in some order.  I.e., there are six different possible values of $n$ all of the form $n=p_1\\cdot p_2^3$ . $81n^4$ thus has prime factorization $81n^4=3^4\\cdot p_1^4\\cdot p_2^{12}$ and a factor count of $5\\cdot5\\cdot13=\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) }325}$  https://youtu.be/hAEsBh64VSY  ~savannahsolver https://youtu.be/ZhAZ1oPe5Ds?t=3694  ~ pi_is_3.14 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxIinK0p8o4&list=PLyhPcpM8aMvJewbDgg6W1h6WjWqP-v4Uy&index=2  - AMBRIGGS\n",

      " For $6$ to $8$ heads, we are guaranteed to hit $4$ heads, so the sum here is $\\binom{8}{2}+\\binom{8}{1}+\\binom{8}{0}=28+8+1=37$ . For $4$ heads, you have to hit the $4$ heads at the start so there's only one way, $1$ . For $5$ heads, we either start off with $4$ heads, which gives us $_4\\text{C}_1=4$ ways to arrange the other flips, or we start off with five heads and one tail, which has $6$ ways minus the $2$ overlapping cases, $\\text{HHHHHTTT}$ and $\\text{HHHHTHTT}$ . Total ways: $8$ . Then we sum to get $46$ . There are a total of $2^8=256$ possible sequences of $8$ coin flips, so the probability is $\\frac{46}{256}=\\frac{23}{128}$ . Summing, we get $23+128=\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }151}$ . Reaching 4 will require either 4, 6, or 8 flips. Therefore we can split into 3 cases: (Case 1): The first four flips are heads. Then, the last four flips can be anything so $2^4=16$ possibilities work. (Case 2): It takes 6 flips to reach 4. There must be one tail in the first four flips so we don't repeat case 1. The tail can be in one of 4 positions. The next two flips must be heads. The last two flips can be anything so $2^2=4$ flips work. $4*4=16$ . (Case 3): It takes 8 flips to reach 4. We can split this case into 2 sub-cases. There can either be 1 or 2 tails in the first 4 flips. (1 tail in first four flips). In this case, the first tail can be in 4 positions. The second tail can be in either the 5th or 6th position so we don't repeat case 2. Thus, there are $4*2=8$ possibilities. (2 tails in first four flips). In this case, the tails can be in $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ positions. Adding these cases up and taking the total out of $2^8=256$ yields $\\frac{16+16+8+6}{256}=\\frac{46}{256}=\\frac{23}{128}$ .

Now, we'll do something different than he did. Draw a dotted line between dots that correspond to 3 on the number line and dots that correspond to 4 on the number line. This is the threshold that must be passed to have a successful sequence. We consider the three entry points to the immediate right of this line. Doing a tiny bit of fun bashing as we slide down this triangle, we find there is 1 way to cross the line for the first time through the uppermost entry point, 4 ways to cross the line for the first time through the middle entry point, and 14 ways to cross the line for the first time through the lowermost entry point. Superimpose Pascal's triangle over the dots. Notice that the number of ways to get to a dot is equal to its corresponding number on Pascal's triangle. Rows on Pascal's triangle sum to powers of 2. There are $2^4=16$ ways to get to the 4th row (remember that when working with Pascal's triangle, we start counting with a 0th row), and we found that 1 of them makes us cross the threshold for the first time. There are $2^6=64$ ways to get to the 6th row, and we found that 4 of them make us cross the threshold for the first time. There are $2^8=256$ ways to get to the 8th row, and we found that 14 of them make us cross the threshold for the first time.

Let the inscribed trapezoid be $ABCD$ , where $AB=BC=CD=2$ and $DA$ is the missing side length. Let $DA=2x$ . If $M$ and $N$ are the midpoints of $BC$ and $AD$ , respectively, the height of the trapezoid is $OM-ON$ . By the pythagorean theorem, $OM=\\sqrt{OB^2-BM^2}=\\sqrt7$ and $ON=\\sqrt{OA^2-AN^2}=\\sqrt{8-x^2}$ . Thus the height of the trapezoid is $\\sqrt7-\\sqrt{8-x^2}$ , so the area is $\\frac{(2+2x)(\\sqrt7-\\sqrt{8-x^2})}{2}=(x+1)(\\sqrt7-\\sqrt{8-x^2})$ .

Dividing both sides by $x+1$ and then squaring, we get $7-2(\\sqrt7)(\\sqrt{8-x^2})+8-x^2=(x+1)(3-x)$ . Expanding the right hand side and canceling the $x^2$ terms gives us $15-2(\\sqrt7)(\\sqrt{8-x^2})=2x+3$ . Rearranging and dividing by two, we get $(\\sqrt7)(\\sqrt{8-x^2})=6-x$ . Squaring both sides, we get $56-7x^2=x^2-12x+36$ . Rearranging, we get $8x^2-12x-20=0$ . Dividing by 4 we get $2x^2-3x-5=0$ . Factoring we get, $(2x-5)(x+1)=0$ , and since $x$ cannot be negative, we get $x=2.5$ . Since $DA=2x$ , $DA=5$ . Scaling up by 100, we get $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E)}\\text{ 500}}$ .

Thus, $AD = \\lvert z^3 - 1 \\rvert = \\lvert (z^2+z+1)/\\sqrt{2} \\rvert = \\lvert (15/8 + 5\\sqrt{7}/8 \\cdot i)/\\sqrt{2} \\rvert = \\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}{4}$ . Scaling back up gives us a final answer of $\\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}{4} \\cdot 200\\sqrt{2} = \\boxed{\\textbf{(E)} 500}$ . ~ Leo.Euler Let angle $C$ be $2a$ . This way $BD$ will be $400sin(a)$ . Now we can trig bash. As the circumradius of triangle $BCD$ is $200\\sqrt{2}$ , we can use the formula \\[R=\\frac{abc}{4A}\\] and \\[A=\\frac{absin(C)}{2}\\] and plug in all the values we got to get \\[200\\sqrt{2}=\\frac{200^2 \\cdot 400sin(a)}{4 \\cdot (\\frac{200^2 sin(2a)}{2})}\\] . This boils down to \\[\\sqrt{2}=\\frac{sin(a)}{sin{2a}}\\] . This expression can further be simplified by the trig identity \\[sin(2a)=2sin(a)cos(a)\\] . This leads to the final simplified form \\[2\\sqrt{2}=\\frac{1}{cos(a)}\\] . Solving this expression gives us \\[cos(a)=\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{4}\\] . However, as we want $sin(a)$ , we use the identity $sin^2+cos^2=1$ , and substitute  to get that $sin(a)=\\frac{\\sqrt{14}}{4}$ , and therefore BD is $100\\sqrt{14}$ . Then, as $ABCD$ is a cyclic quadrilateral, we can use Ptolemy’s Theorem (with $AD=x$ ) to get \\[14 \\cdot 100^2=200x+200^2\\] . Finally, we solve to get $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) } 500}$ . -dragoon [asy] size(250); defaultpen(linewidth(0.4)); //Variable Declarations real RADIUS; pair A, B, C, D, O; RADIUS=3;  //Variable Definitions A=RADIUS*dir(148.414); B=RADIUS*dir(109.471); C=RADIUS*dir(70.529); D=RADIUS*dir(31.586); O=(0,0);  //Path Definitions path quad= A -- B -- C -- D -- cycle;  //Initial Diagram draw(Circle(O, RADIUS), linewidth(0.8)); draw(quad, linewidth(0.8)); label(\"$A$\",A,W); label(\"$B$\",B,NW); label(\"$C$\",C,NE); label(\"$D$\",D,E); label(\"$O$\",O,S);  //Radii draw(O--A); draw(O--B); draw(O--C); draw(O--D);  [/asy] Claim: $[ABCD]$ is an isosceles trapezoid. Proof: Notice that $[ABCD]$ is cyclic, triangle $BOC$ is isosceles, and triangle $AOB$ is congruent to $DOC$ by SSS congruence. Therefore, $\\angle BAD = 180 - \\angle BCD = 180-(\\angle BCO + \\angle DCO)=180-(\\angle CBO+\\angle ABO) = 180 - \\angle ABC = \\angle CDA$ . Hence, $[ABCD]$ is an isosceles trapezoid. Let $\\angle CDA=\\alpha$ . Notice that the length of the altitude from $C$ to $AD$ is $200sin(\\alpha)$ . Furthermore, the length of the altitude from $O$ to $BC$ is $100\\sqrt{7}$ by the Pythagorean theorem. Therefore, the length of the altitude from $O$ to $AD$ is $100\\sqrt{7}-200sin\\alpha$ . Let $F$ the feet of the altitude from $O$ to $AD$ . Then, $FD=(200+400cos(\\alpha))/2=100+200cos(\\alpha)$ , because $AOD$ is isosceles. Therefore, by the Pythagorean theorem, $(100+200cos(\\alpha))^2+(100\\sqrt{7}-200sin(\\alpha))^2=80000$ . Simplifying, we have $1+cos(\\alpha)=sin(\\alpha) \\cdot sqrt{7} \\implies cos^2(\\alpha)+2cos(\\alpha)+1=sin^2(\\alpha) \\cdot 7 = 7-7cos^2(\\alpha) \\implies 8cos^2(\\alpha)+2cos(\\alpha) - 6 =0$ . Solving this quadratic, we have $cos(\\alpha)=\\frac{3}{4}, -1$ , but $0<\\alpha<180 \\implies cos(\\alpha)=3/4$ . Therefore, $AD=200cos(\\alpha)+200cos(\\alpha)+200=\\boxed{500}$  - [mathMagicOPS] This problem is related to M. T. Naraniengar's proof of Morley's Trisector Theorem .

      " We prime factorize $72,600,$ and $900$ . The prime factorizations are $2^3\\times 3^2$ , $2^3\\times 3\\times 5^2$ and $2^2\\times 3^2\\times 5^2$ , respectively. Let $x=2^a\\times 3^b\\times 5^c$ , $y=2^d\\times 3^e\\times 5^f$ and $z=2^g\\times 3^h\\times 5^i$ . We know that \\[\\max(a,d)=3\\]  \\[\\max(b,e)=2\\]  \\[\\max(a,g)=3\\]  \\[\\max(b,h)=1\\]  \\[\\max(c,i)=2\\]  \\[\\max(d,g)=2\\]  \\[\\max(e,h)=2\\] and $c=f=0$ since $\\text{lcm}(x,y)$ isn't a multiple of 5. Since $\\max(d,g)=2$ we know that $a=3$ . We also know that since $\\max(b,h)=1$ that $e=2$ . So now some equations have become useless to us...let's take them out. \\[\\max(b,h)=1\\]  \\[\\max(d,g)=2\\] are the only two important ones left. We do casework on each now. If $\\max(b,h)=1$ then $(b,h)=(1,0),(0,1)$ or $(1,1)$ . Similarly if $\\max(d,g)=2$ then $(d,g)=(2,0),(2,1),(2,2),(1,2),(0,2)$ . Thus our answer is $5\\times 3=\\boxed{\\textbf{(A) }15}.$  It is well known that if the $\\text{lcm}(a,b)=c$ and $c$ can be written as $p_1^ap_2^bp_3^c\\dots$ , then the highest power of all prime numbers $p_1,p_2,p_3\\dots$ must divide into either $a$ and/or $b$ . Or else a lower $c_0=p_1^{a-\\epsilon}p_2^{b-\\epsilon}p_3^{c-\\epsilon}\\dots$ is the $\\text{lcm}$ . Start from $x$ : $\\text{lcm}(x,y)=72$ so $8\\mid x$ or $9\\mid x$ or both. But $9\\nmid x$ because $\\text{lcm}(x,z)=600$ and $9\\nmid 600$ .\n",
      "So $x=8,24$ . $y$ can be $9,18,36$ in both cases of $x$ but NOT $72$ because $\\text{lcm}(y,z)=900$ and $72\\nmid 900$ . So there are six sets of $x,y$ and we will list all possible values of $z$ based on those. $25\\mid z$ because $z$ must source all powers of $5$ . $z\\in\\{25,50,75,100,150,300\\}$ . $z\\ne\\{200,225\\}$ because of $\\text{lcm}$ restrictions. By different sourcing of powers of $2$ and $3$ , \\[(8,9):z=300\\]  \\[(8,18):z=300\\]  \\[(8,36):z=75,150,300\\]  \\[(24,9):z=100,300\\]  \\[(24,18):z=100,300\\]  \\[(24,36):z=25,50,75,100,150,300\\]  $z=100$ is \"enabled\" by $x$ sourcing the power of $3$ . $z=75,150$ is uncovered by $y$ sourcing all powers of $2$ . And $z=25,50$ is uncovered by $x$ and $y$ both at full power capacity. Counting the cases, $1+1+3+2+2+6=\\boxed{\\textbf{(A) }15}.$  As said in previous solutions, start by factoring $72, 600,$ and $900$ . The prime factorizations are as follows: \\[72=2^3\\cdot 3^2,\\]  \\[600=2^3\\cdot 3\\cdot 5^2,\\]  \\[\\text{and } 900=2^2\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 5^2\\] To organize $x,y, \\text{ and } z$ and their respective LCMs in a simpler way, we can draw a triangle as follows such that $x,y, \\text{and } z$ are the vertices and the LCMs are on the edges.

Turning towards the vertices $y$ and $z$ , we know at least one of them must have $2^2$ as its factors. Therefore, we have $5$ ways for the powers of $2$ for $y \\text{ and } z$ since the only ones that satisfy the previous conditions are for ordered pairs $(y,z) \\{(2,0)(2,1)(0,2)(1,2)(2,2)\\}$ .

Moving onto $x \\text{ and } z$ , we can use the same logic to find the only ordered pairs $(x,z)$ that will work are $\\{(1,0)(0,1)(1,1)\\}$ . The final and last case is the powers of $5$ .

      " AMC12 2006 A 23.png Because we can let the the sides of the triangle be any variable we want, to make it easier for us when solving, let’s let the side lengths be $x,y,$ and $a$ . WLOG assume $a$ is the largest. Then, $x+y>a$ , meaning the solution is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C)}\\;1/2}$ , as shown in the graph below. [asy] pair A = (0,0); pair B = (1,0); pair C = (1,1); pair D = (0,1); pair E = (0,0);  draw(A--B--C--D--cycle); draw(B--D,dashed); fill(B--D--C--cycle,gray);  label(\"$0$\",A,SW); label(\"$a$\",B,S); label(\"$a$\",D,W); label(\"$y$\",(0,.5),W); label(\"$x$\",(.5,0),S); label(\"$x+y>a$\",(5/7,5/7)); [/asy]  WLOG, let the largest of the three numbers drawn be $a>0$ .  Then the other two numbers are drawn uniformly and independently from the interval $[0,a]$ .  The probability that their sum is greater than $a$ is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C)}\\;1/2.}$  When $a>b$ , consider two cases: 1) $0<a<\\frac{1}{2}$ , then $\\int_{0}^{\\frac{1}{2}} \\int_{0}^{a}2b \\,\\text{d}b\\,\\text{d}a=\\frac{1}{24}$  2) $\\frac{1}{2}<a<1$ , then $\\int_{\\frac{1}{2}}^{1} \\left(\\int_{0}^{1-a}2b \\,\\text{d}b + \\int_{1-a}^{a}1+b-a \\,db\\right)\\text{d}a=\\frac{5}{24}$  $a<b$ is the same. Thus the answer is $\\frac{1}{2}$ . The probability of this occurring is the volume of the corresponding region within a $1 \\times 1 \\times 1$ cube, where each point $(x,y,z)$ corresponds to a choice of values for each of $x, y,$ and $z$ . The region where, WLOG, side $z$ is too long, $z\\geq x+y$ , is a pyramid with a base of area $\\frac{1}{2}$ and height $1$ , so its volume is $\\frac{\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot 1}{3}=\\frac{1}{6}$ . Accounting for the corresponding cases in $x$ and $y$ multiplies our answer by $3$ , so we have excluded a total volume of $\\frac{1}{2}$ from the space of possible probabilities. Subtracting this from $1$ leaves us with a final answer of $\\frac{1}{2}$ . The probability of this occurring is the volume of the corresponding region within a $1 \\times 1 \\times 1$ cube, where each point $(x,y,z)$ corresponds to a choice of values for each of $x, y,$ and $z$ .  We take a horizontal cross section of the cube, essentially picking a value for z.  The area where the triangle inequality will not hold is when $x + y < z$ , which has area $\\frac{z^2}{2}$ or when $x+z<y$ or $y+z<x$ , which have an area of $\\frac{(1-z)^2}{2}+\\frac{(1-z)^2}{2} = (1-z)^2.$ Integrating this expression from 0 to 1 in the form $\\int_0^1 \\left(\\frac{z^2}{2} + (1-z)^2\\right) dz = \\bigg[\\frac{z^3}{2} - z^2 + z \\biggr |_0^1 = \\frac{1}{2} -1 + 1 = \\frac{1}{2}$  Solution 5.1 (better explanation) This problem is going to require some geometric probability, so let's dive right in.\n",
      "Take three integers $x$ , $y$ , and $z$ . Then for the triangle inequality to hold, the following $3$ inequalities must be true \\[x + y > z\\]  \\[y + z > x\\]  \\[x + z > y\\]  Now, it would be really easy if these equations only had two variables instead of $3$ , because then we could graph it in a $2$ -dimensional plane instead of a $3$ -dimensional cube. So, we assume $z$ is a constant. We will deal with it later. Now, since we are graphing, we should probably write these equations in terms of $y$ so they are in slope-intercept form and are easier to graph. \\[y > -x + z\\]  \\[y > x - z\\]  \\[y < x + z\\]  Now, note that all solutions $(x,y)$ are in a $1$  $x$  $1$ square in the $xy$ -plane because $x$ , $y \\in [0, 1]$ . I recommend drawing the following figure to get an idea of what is going on.\n",
      "The first line is a line with a negative slope that cuts off a $45-45-90$ triangle with side length $z$ of the bottom left corner of the square. The second line is a line with a positive slope that cuts off a $45-45-90$ triangle with side length $1-z$ off the top left corner of the square. The third line also has a positive slope and cuts a $45-45-90$ triangle with side length $1 - z$ off the bottom right corner of the square. Note: All triangles are $45-45-90$ because the lines have slopes of $1$ or $-1$ . Using the $>$ and $<$ signs in the lines, we see that the area that satisfies all three inequalities is the area not enclosed in the three triangles. So, our plan of attack will be to Find the area of the triangles -> Subtract that from the area of the square -> Use probability to get the answer. Except, now, we have one problem. $z$ is still a variable. But, we want $z$ to be a constant. Well, what if we just took the area over every possible value of $z$ ? Well, that would be a bit hard, if not impossible to do by hand, but there is a handy math tool that will let us do that: the integral! To find the area of the triangles, our plan of attack will be Find the area in terms of $z$ -> take the integral from $0$ to $1$ of the expression for the area (this will cover every possible value of $z$  The area of the triangles is \\[\\frac{z^2}{2} + (1-z)^2 = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(-3x^2 + 4x\\right)\\] . The integral from $0$ to $1$ is \\[\\frac{1}{2}\\int_0^1\\left(-3x^2 + 4x\\right)dx = \\frac{1}{2}\\]  The total area of all the possible unit squares is quite obviously \\[\\int_0^11dx = 1\\]  Thus, the area not enclosed by the triangles is $1 - \\dfrac{1}{2} = \\dfrac{1}{2}$ , and the total area of the square is $1$ . Thus, the desired probability is \\[\\frac{\\frac{1}{2}}{1} = \\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }\\frac12}\\]  ~Extremelysupercooldude WLOG assume that $z$ is the largest number and hence the largest side. Then $x,y \\leq z$ . We can set up a square that is $z$ by $z$ in the $xy$ plane. We are wanting all the points within this square that satisfy $x+y > z$ . This happens to be a line dividing the square into 2 equal regions. Thus the answer is $\\frac{1}{2}$ . [][] diagram for this problem goes here (z by z square) The triangle inequality simplifies to considering only one case: $\\text{the smallest side+ the second smallest side} > \\text{the largest side}$ . Consider the complement (the same statement, except with a less than or equal to).  Assume (WLOG) $a$ is the largest, so on average $a=1/2$ (now equal to becomes a degenerate case with probability $0$ , so we no longer need to consider it). We now want $b+c<1/2$ , so imagine choosing $b+c$ at once rather than independently. But we know that $b+c$ is between $0$ and $2$ . The complement is thus: $(1/2-0)/2=1/4$ . But keep in mind that we choose each $b$ and $c$ randomly and independently, so if there are $k$ ways to choose $b+c$ together, there are $2k$ ways to choose them separately, and therefore the complement actually doubles to match each case (a good example of this is to restrict b and c to integers such that if $b+c=3$ , then we only count this once, but in reality: we have two cases $1+2$ , and $2+1$ ; similar reasoning also generalizes to non-integral values). The complement is then actually $2(1/4)=1/2$ . Therefore, our desired probability is given by $1-\\text{complement}=1/2, C$  We can draw a 3D space where each coordinate is in the range [0,1]. Drawing the lines $x+y>z, x+z>y,$ and $y+z>x,$ We have a 3D space that consists of two tetrahedrons. One is a regular tetrahedron with side length $\\sqrt2$ and the other has 3 sides of length $\\sqrt2$ and 3 sides of length $1.$ The volume of this region is $\\frac 1 2$ . Hence our solution is $C.$  Consider a stick of length $1$ . Cutting the stick at two random points gives a triangle from the three new segments. These two random points must be on opposite sides of the halfway mark. Thus, after the first cut is made, there is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }\\frac12}$ probability that the second cut is on the opposite side. -this isn't necessarily true: what if the cuts are very very close to the edges? -happypi31415 -alanisawesome2018 https://youtu.be/DDRRP9VLYO8  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqRsTNB89ps&list=PLyhPcpM8aMvI7N78mYZyatqveRU30iNcf&index=3  - AMBRIGGS\n",

      " Consider $f(2)$ . The numbers left on the blackboard will show the hundreds place at the end. In order for the hundreds place to differ by 2, the difference between two perfect squares needs to be at least $100$ . Since $100\\le (x+1)^2-x^2=2x+1$ , this first happens at $x\\ge \\lfloor 99/2\\rfloor = 50$ . The perfect squares from here go: $2500,  2601, 2704, 2809\\dots$ . Note that the ones and tens also make the perfect squares, $1^2,2^2,3^2\\dots$ . After the ones and tens make $100$ , the hundreds place will go up by $2$ , thus reaching our goal. Since $10^2=100$ , the last perfect square to be written will be $\\left(50+10\\right)^2=60^2=3600$ . The missing number is one less than the number of hundreds $(k=2)$ of $3600$ , or $35$ . Now consider $f(4)$ . Instead of the difference between two squares needing to be $100$ , the difference must now be $10000$ . This first happens at $x\\ge 5000$ . After this point, similarly, $\\sqrt{10000}=100$ more numbers are needed to make the $10^4$ th's place go up by $2$ . This will take place at $\\left(5000+100\\right)^2=5100^2= 26010000$ . Removing the last four digits (the zeros) and subtracting one yields $2600$ for the skipped value. In general, each new value of $f(k+2)$ will add two digits to the \" $5$ \" and one digit to the \" $1$ \". This means that the last number Bernardo writes for $k=6$ is $\\left(500000+1000\\right)^2$ , the last for $k = 8$ will be $\\left(50000000+10000\\right)^2$ , and so on until $k=2016$ . Removing the last $k$ digits as Silvia does will be the same as removing $k/2$ trailing zeroes on the number to be squared. This means that the last number on the board for $k=6$ is $5001^2$ , $k=8$ is $50001^2$ , and so on. So the first missing number is $5001^2-1,50001^2-1\\text{ etc.}$ The squaring will make a \" $25$ \" with two more digits than the last number, a \" $10$ \" with one more digit, and a \" $1$ \". The missing number is one less than that, so the \"1\" will be subtracted from $f(k)$ . In other words, $f(k) = 25\\cdot 10^{k-2}+1\\cdot 10^{k/2}$ . Therefore: \\[f(2) =35 =25 +10\\]  \\[f(4) =2600 =2500 +100\\]  \\[f(6) =251000 =250000 +1000\\]  \\[f(8) = 25010000 = 25000000 + 10000\\]  And so on. The sum $f(2) + f(4) + f(6) +\\dots + f(2016)$ is: $2.52525252525\\dots 2525\\cdot 10^{2015}$ + $1.11111\\dots 110\\cdot 10^{1008}$ , with $2016$ repetitions each of \" $25$ \" and \" $1$ \". \n",
      "There is no carrying in this addition. Therefore each $f(k)$ adds $2 + 5 + 1 = 8$ to the sum of the digits. \n",

However, since density and thickness are the same and $A$ is proportional to $s^2$ (recognizing that the area of an equilateral triangle is $\\frac{(s)^2\\sqrt{3}}{4}$ ), we can say that $m$ is proportional to $s^2$ .

      " By Albert471 To start, use algebra to determine the number of posts on each side. You have (the long sides count for $2$ because there are twice as many) $6x = 20 + 4$ (each corner is double counted so you must add $4$ ) Making the shorter end have $4$ , and the longer end have $8$ . $((8-1)*4)*((4-1)*4) = 28*12 = 336$ . Therefore, the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B)}\\ 336}$  To start, allocate 4 posts from the total 20 to be the corners. Now 16 posts are left. Pairing each long and short side together, you have 8 posts for a segment of long and short (For rectangle ABCD, AB = CD, AC = BD, we are taking what is originally AB + BC + CD + DA = 16, and making it AB + AC = 8). From 8, you need two numbers that add up too 8, that when you add 2 to both of them are at a 1:2 ratio. Brute force says these numbers are 6 and 2. 6 + 2 = 12, and (6+2) = 2(2+2). Then it is trivial to calculate area, as the long side has 8 posts, short side has 4, the total length of the long side is 28, and the short side 12. 28 x 12 = 336. ~Shadow-18\n",

In the rightmost column, there are $12$ squares with length $1$ because $y=4*\\pi$ generates squares from $(4,0)$ to $(4,4\\pi)$ , and continuing on we have $9$ , $6$ , and $3$ for $x$ -values for $1$ , $2$ , and $3$ in the equation $y=\\pi x$ . So there are $12+9+6+3 = 30$ squares with length $1$ in the figure. For $2*2$ squares, each square takes up $2$ units left and $2$ units up. Squares can also overlap. For $2*2$ squares, the rightmost column stretches from $(3,0)$ to $(3,3\\pi)$ , so there are $8$ squares with length $2$ in a $2$ by $9$ box.

Squares with length $3$ in the rightmost column start at $(2,0)$ and end at $(2,2\\pi)$ , so there are $4$ such squares in the right column. As the left row starts at $(1,0)$ and ends at $(1,\\pi)$ there are $4+1=5$ squares with length $3$ .

      " The second term in a geometric series is $a_2 = a \\cdot r$ , where $r$ is the common ratio for the series and $a$ is the first term of the series. So we know that $a\\cdot r = 1$ and we wish to find the minimum value of the infinite sum of  the series. We know that: $S_\\infty = \\frac{a}{1-r}$ and substituting in $a=\\frac{1}{r}$ , we get that $S_\\infty = \\frac{\\frac{1}{r}}{1-r} = \\frac{1}{r(1-r)} = \\frac{1}{r}+\\frac{1}{1-r}$ . From here, you can either use calculus or AM-GM. $\\textbf{Calculus}$  Let $f(x) = \\frac{1}{x-x^2} = (x-x^2)^{-1}$ , then $f'(x) = -(x-x^2)^{-2}\\cdot (1-2x)$ . Since $f(0)$ and $f(1)$ are undefined $x \\neq 0,1$ . This means that we only need to find where the derivative equals $0$ , meaning $1-2x = 0 \\Rightarrow x =\\frac{1}{2}$ . So $r = \\frac{1}{2}$ , meaning that $S_\\infty = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{2} - (\\frac{1}{2})^2} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{1}{4}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{4}} = 4$  $\\textbf{AM-GM}$  For 2 positive real numbers $a$ and $b$ , $\\frac{a+b}{2} \\geq \\sqrt{ab}$ . Let $a = \\frac{1}{r}$ and $b = \\frac{1}{1-r}$ . Then: $\\frac{\\frac{1}{r}+\\frac{1}{1-r}}{2} \\geq \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{r}\\cdot\\frac{1}{1-r}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{r}+\\frac{1}{1-r}}$ . This implies that $\\frac{S_\\infty}{2} \\geq \\sqrt{S_\\infty}$ . or $S_\\infty^2 \\geq 4 \\cdot S_\\infty$ . Rearranging : $(S_\\infty-2)^2 \\geq 4 \\Rightarrow S_\\infty - 2 \\geq 2 \\Rightarrow S_\\infty \\geq 4$ . Thus, the smallest value is $S_\\infty = 4$ . The sum of the geometric sequence is $\\frac{a}{1 - r}$ where $a$ is the first term and $r$ is the common ratio. We know the second term, $ar,$ is equal to $1.$ Thus $ar = 1 \\Rightarrow a = \\frac{1}{r}.$ This means, \\[S = \\frac{a}{1 - r} = \\frac{1/r}{1 - r} = \\frac{1}{r(1 - r)}.\\] In order to minimize $S,$ we maximize the denominator. By AM-GM, \\[\\frac{(r) + (1 - r)}{2} \\ge \\sqrt{r(1-r)} \\Rightarrow \\frac{1}{4} \\ge r(1-r).\\] Equality occurs at $r = 1-r \\Rightarrow r = \\frac{1}{2}.$ This gives the minimum value of $S$ as $\\frac{\\frac{1}{1/2}}{1 - \\frac{1}{2}} = \\boxed{(E)~4}.$  A geometric sequence always looks like \\[a,ar,ar^2,ar^3,\\dots\\]  and they say that the second term $ar=1$ . You should know that the sum of an infinite geometric series (denoted by $S$ here) is $\\frac{a}{1-r}$ . We now have a system of equations which allows us to find $S$ in one variable. \\begin{align*} ar&=1 \\\\ S&=\\frac{a}{1-r} \\end{align*}  $\\textbf{Solving in terms of \\textit{a} then graphing}$  \\[S=\\frac{a^2}{a-1}\\]  We seek the smallest positive value of $S$ . We proceed by graphing in the $aS$ plane (if you want to be rigorous, only stop graphing when you know all the rest you didn't graph is just the approaching of asymptotes and infinities) and find the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E)}\\ 4}.$  $\\textbf{Solving in terms of \\textit{r} then graphing}$  \\[S=\\frac{1}{-r^2+r}\\]  We seek the smallest positive value of $S$ . We proceed by graphing in the $rS$ plane (if you want to be rigorous, only stop graphing when you know all the rest you didn't graph is just the approaching of asymptotes and infinities) and find the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E)}\\ 4}.$  $\\textbf{Solving in terms of \\textit{a} then doing some calculus}$  \\[S=\\frac{a^2}{a-1}\\]  We seek the smallest positive value of $S$ . $\\frac{(a-2)a}{(a-1)^2}=S'$ and $\\frac{(a-2)a}{(a-1)^2}=0$ at $a=0$ and $a=2$ . $\\frac{2}{(a-1)^3}=S''$ and $\\frac{2}{(0-1)^3}$ is negative (implying a relative maximum occurs at $a=0$ ) and $\\frac{2}{(2-1)^3}$ is positive (implying a relative minimum occurs at $a=2$ ).  At $a=2$ , $S=4$ . Since this a competition math problem with an answer, we know this relative minimum must also be the absolute minimum among the \"positive parts\" of $S$ and that our answer is indeed $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E)}\\ 4}.$ However, to be sure of this outside of this cop-out, one can analyze the end behavior of $S$ , how $S$ behaves at its asymptotes, and the locations of its maxima and minima relative to the asymptotes to be sure that 4 is the absolute minimum among the \"positive parts\" of $S$ . $\\textbf{Solving in terms of \\textit{r} then being clever}$  \\[S=\\frac{1}{-r^2+r}\\]  We seek the smallest positive value of $S$ . We could use calculus like we did in the solution immediately above this one, but that's a lot of work and we don't have a ton of time. To minimize the positive value of this fraction, we must maximize the denominator. The denominator is a quadratic that opens down, so its maximum occurs at its vertex. The vertex of this quadratic occurs at $x=\\frac{1}{2}$ and $\\frac{1}{-(\\frac{1}{2})^2+\\frac{1}{2}}=\\boxed{\\textbf{(E)}\\ 4}$ . \\[\\textbf{Completing the Square and Quadratics}\\] Let $r$ be the common ratio. If the second term is $1$ , the first must be $\\frac{1}{r}$ . By the infinite geometric series formula, the sum must be \\[S=\\frac{\\frac{1}{r}}{1-r}\\] This equals $\\frac{1}{r(1-r)}$ . To find the minimum value of S, we must find the maximum value of the denominator, $r(1-r)$ , which is $\\frac{1}{4}$ , completing the square. Thus, the minimum value of $S$ is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E)}\\ 4}$ . Our sequence is $a_1,1,...$ . Since we know this is a converging series, our ratio is in $(0,1)$ . Because the 2nd term in the sequence is a 1, the ratio must be $\\frac{1}{a_1}$ , so we can write $S$ as $\\frac{a_1}{1-\\frac{1}{a_1}}$ . With some manipulation we get $S=\\frac{1}{a_1-1}$ . Since S has to be a \"positive number,\" we come to think $a_1$ is $2$ (makes S positive & we know a sequence/series of a ratio $1/2$ is definitely convergent). So our sequence is $2,1,1/2,1,4,...$ , $2+1+1=\\boxed{\\textbf{(E)}\\ 4}$ .\n",
      "-thedodecagon As in the previous solutions, $S=\\frac{1}{r-r^2} \\implies Sr^2-Sr+1=0 \\implies \\text{discriminant}=S^2-4S \\ge 0$ since we know that such an $r$ exists. We then have $S \\ge 4$ for positive $S,$ and this is achievable when $r=.5,$ so the answer is $4.$ \n",

This gives us the maximum for each vertex, multiplied by the 8 vertices, yields our answer $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D)}\\ 729 }$ Also note that if you cannot evaluate $4.5^3$ quickly, a rough approximation of $5*4.5*4*8$ will yield 720, very close to our answer. -rayprati Note about note above: $4.5=\\frac{9}{2}.$ So, we want to evaluate $(\\frac{9}{2})^3 \\cdot 8 = \\frac{729}{8} \\cdot 8 = 729.$ So, it’s quite easy to evaluate ~solasky It is obvious to put $5$ , $6$ , and $7$ on the faces that share the same vertex. As $4$ is the next biggest number, the face with $4$ has to be next to the faces with $6$ and $7$ . As $4$ is the next biggest number, the face with $3$ has to be next to the faces with $5$ and $7$ . making the face with $2$ next to the faces with $6$ and $5$ .

      " We proceed with this problem by considering two cases, when: 1) There are an odd number of consecutive numbers, 2) There are an even number of consecutive numbers. For the first case, we can cleverly choose the convenient form of our sequence to be \\[a-n,\\cdots, a-1, a, a+1, \\cdots, a+n\\]  because then our sum will just be $(2n+1)a$ . We now have \\[(2n+1)a = 345\\] and $a$ will have a solution when $\\frac{345}{2n+1}$ is an integer, namely when $2n+1$ is a divisor of 345. We check that \\[2n+1 = 3, 5, 15, 23\\] work, and no more, because $2n+1=1$ does not satisfy the requirements of two or more consecutive integers, and when $2n+1$ equals the next biggest factor, $69$ , there must be negative integers in the sequence. Our solutions are $\\{114,115, 116\\}, \\{67, \\cdots, 71\\}, \\{16, \\cdots, 30\\}, \\{4, \\cdots, 26\\}$ . For the even cases, we choose our sequence to be of the form: \\[a-(n-1), \\cdots, a, a+1, \\cdots, a+n\\] so the sum is $\\frac{(2n)(2a+1)}{2} = n(2a+1)$ . In this case, we find our solutions to be $\\{172, 173\\}, \\{55,\\cdots, 60\\}, \\{30,\\cdots, 39\\}$ . We have found all 7 solutions and our answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E)} \\, 7}$ . The sum from $a$ to $b$ where $a$ and $b$ are integers and $a>b$ is $S=\\dfrac{(a-b+1)(a+b)}{2}$  $345=\\dfrac{(a-b+1)(a+b)}{2}$  $2\\cdot 3\\cdot 5\\cdot 23=(a-b+1)(a+b)$  Let $c=a-b+1$ and $d=a+b$  $2\\cdot 3\\cdot 5\\cdot 23=c\\cdot d$  If we factor $690$ into all of its factor groups $(\\text{exg}~ (10,69) ~\\text{or} ~(15,46))$ we will have several ordered pairs $(c,d)$ where $c<d$  The number of possible values for $c$ is half the number of factors of $690$ which is $\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot2\\cdot2\\cdot2\\cdot2=8$  However, we have one extraneous case of $(1,690)$ because here, $a=b$ and we have the sum of one consecutive number which is not allowed by the question. Thus the answer is $8-1=7$  $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E)} \\,7}$ . The consecutive sums can be written as $345=kn+\\sum_{i=1}^{k-1}{i}$ where $k$ is the number of terms in a sequence, and $n$ is the first term. Then, $\\{k,n\\}\\in \\mathbb{N}$ and $k\\geq2$ . Evaluating the sum and rearranging yields $n=\\frac{345}{k}-\\frac{k-1}{2}$ . The prime factorization of $345$ is $1\\cdot3\\cdot5\\cdot23$ . Then, $3\\cdot5$ , $3\\cdot23$ , and $5\\cdot23$ are also divisors.  As odd divisors of $345$ , note that they all produce integer solutions to $n$ as $k$ . Only $k!=1$ is not valid, as $k\\geq2$ . Similarly, quickly notice that $k=2$ is a solution. Multiplying an odd divisor by $2$ always yields an integer solution (see below). As such, the even integer solutions are $k=2, 2\\cdot3, 2\\cdot5, 2\\cdot15 ... 2\\cdot345$ . Note that the function is decreasing for increasing values of $k$ and that $\\frac{345}{k}-\\frac{k-1}{2}=4$ for $k=23$ . Thus, when $n$ is negative, $k$ is only slightly more than $k=23$ . Recall $\\{k,n\\}\\in \\mathbb{N}$ . Since the next highest solution, $k=2\\cdot23=46$ is twice $k=23$ , $k\\leq23$ . Thus, the remaining solutions are when $k=2,6,10,3,5,15,23$  $\\implies \\boxed{\\textbf{(E)} \\,7}$ .  This is proven by the fact that an odd number ( $345$ in this case) divided by an divisor always yields an odd number. Dividing this by $2$ produces a number in the form $z+\\frac{k-1}{2}$ , where z is an integer. Since an even number multiplied by an odd number also yields an even number, $\\frac{k-1}{2}$ similarly is in the form $z+\\frac{k-1}{2}$ , producing an integer. (Solution by BJHHar) We're dealing with an increasing arithmetic progression of common difference 1. Let $x$ be the number of terms in a summation. Let $y$ be the first term in a summation. The sum of an arithmetic progression is the average of the first term and the last term multiplied by the number of terms. The problem tells us that the sum must be 345. \\begin{align*} x \\cdot \\frac{y+y+[(x-1)1]}{2}&=345 \\\\ 2xy+x^2-x&=690 \\end{align*}  In order to satisfy the constraints of the problem, x and y must be positive integers. Maybe we can make this into a Diophantine thing! In fact, if we just factor out that $x$ ... voilà! \\[(x)(x+2y-1)=690\\]  There are 16 possible factor pairs to try (for brevity, I will not enumerate them here). Notice that the expression in the right parenthesis is $2y-1$ more than the expression in the parenthesis on the left. $y$ is at least 1. Thus, the expression in the right parenthesis will always be greater than the expression on the left. This eliminates 8 factor pairs. The problem also says the \"increasing sequence\" has to have \"two or more\" terms, so $x \\geqslant 2$ . This eliminates the factor pair $1 \\cdot 690$ . With brief testing, we find that the the other 7 factor pairs produce 7 viable ordered pairs. This means we have found $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E)}\\ 7}$ ways to write 345 in the silly way outlined by the problem. By the sum of an arithmetic sequence... this ultimately comes to $n+n+1+n+2....+n+p=345=(2n+p)(p+1)=690=23\\cdot3\\cdot5\\cdot2$ . Quick testing (would take you roughly a minute) We see that the first 7 values of $p$ that work are $p=1,2,4,5,9,14,22$ . We see that each one of them works.\n",
      "Hence, the answer is $\\boxed{7}$ .  The sum of all integers from $x$ to $y$ inclusive is equal to \\[\\frac{y(y+1)}{2}-\\left(\\frac{x(x+1)}{2}\\right)+x.\\]  In words, $x$ added to sum of the first $x$ positive inegers subtracted from the sum of the first positive $y$ integers. Setting this equal to $345$ and multiplying by $2$ to clear fractions, we can see that \\[y(y+1)-x(x+1)+2x\\]  \\[=y^2-x^2+y+x\\]  \\[=(y+x)(y-x+1)=690.\\] Now we know that, $y+x$ and $y-x+1$ multiply together to $690$ , and they're both integers. Now, we can set $y+x$ and $y-x+1$ equal to factors of $690$ . Clearly, $x>\\frac{1}{2},$ so $y+x$ will take the larger of the two factors. We can factorize $690$ as $1\\cdot2\\cdot3\\cdot5\\cdot23$ . We also know that when solving for $y$ , we can add the two systems in $y+x$ and $y-x+1$ to get a new equation in terms of $2y+1.$ In order for $y$ to be an integer, the sum of the two factors must be odd. We also know that there is only one factor of $2$ , so either $y+x$ or $y-x+1$ will be even. The number of odd factors multiplied together can either be $1, 2$ or $3$ (0 doesn't work, since $(690, 1)$ doesn't). There are a total of $3$ odd numbers present in our new prime factorization, now excluding $1$ . Therefore, the number of combinations that yield integral values for both $x$ and $y$ are \\[{3\\choose1}+{3\\choose2}+{3\\choose3}= \\boxed{\\textbf{E)} 7}\\] . -Benedict T (countmath1) https://youtu.be/KhH6CkuYg_E  ~savannahsolver\n",

      " We use complementary counting. First, because each team played $20$ other teams, there are $21$ teams total. All sets that do not have $A$ beat $B$ , $B$ beat $C$ , and $C$ beat $A$ have one team that beats both the other teams. Thus we must count the number of sets of three teams such that one team beats the two other teams and subtract that number from the total number of ways to choose three teams. There are $21$ ways to choose the team that beat the two other teams, and $\\binom{10}{2} = 45$ to choose two teams that the first team both beat. This is $21 * 45 = 945$ sets. There are $\\binom{21}{3} = 1330$ sets of three teams total. Subtracting, we obtain $1330 - 945 = \\boxed{385}$ , thus $(\\text{A})$ is our answer. As above, note that there are 21 teams, and call them A, B, C, ... T, U. WLOG, assume that A beat teams B-L and lost to teams M-U. We will count the number of sets satisfying the “cycle-win” condition—e.g. here, A beats a team in X which beats a team in Y which beats A. The first and third part of the condition are already met by our wlog, so we just need to count of number of ways the second condition is true (a team in X beats a team in Y). These are the number of cycle-wins that include A, then multiply by 21 (for each team) and divide by 3 (since every set will be counted by each of the 3 teams that are a part of that set). To do this, let X $=\\{B, ..., L\\}$ and Y $=\\{M, ..., U\\}$ . Since a total of $10*10=100$ losses total were suffered by teams in Y and $\\binom{10}{2}=45^{*}$ losses were suffered by teams in Y from teams in Y, we have $100-45=55$ losses suffered by teams in Y from teams in X. Hence, for each of these $55$ losses, there is exactly one set of three teams that includes A that satisfies the problem conditions. Thus, the answer is $\\frac{55\\cdot 21}{3}=\\boxed{385}$ .  $~^{*}$ the number of ways that two teams in Y play each other — each face-off guarantees 1 loss (and 1 win) Note that there are $21$ teams total and $\\binom{21}{3}=1330$ ways to pick ${A,B,C}.$ The possible arrangements are one team beats the other two or they each win/lose equally (we want the second case). Approximately $\\frac{1}{4}$ of all the arrangements satisfy the second case, and $\\frac{1330}{4}=332.5,$ which is by far the closest to $\\boxed{(A)}.$ \n",

      " Solution 1 (By Qwertazertl) We are tasked with finding the sum of the areas of every $\\triangle DQ_i^{}P_i^{}$ where $i$ is a positive integer. We can start by finding the area of the first triangle, $\\triangle DQ_1^{}P_1^{}$ . This is equal to $\\frac{1}{2}$ ⋅ $DQ_1^{}$ ⋅ $P_1^{}Q_2^{}$ . Notice that since triangle $\\triangle DQ_1^{}P_1^{}$ is similar to triangle $\\triangle ABP_1^{}$ in a 1 : 2 ratio, $P_1^{}Q_2^{}$ must equal $\\frac{1}{3}$ (since we are dealing with a unit square whose side lengths are 1). $DQ_1^{}$ is of course equal to $\\frac{1}{2}$ as it is the mid-point of CD. Thus, the area of the first triangle is $[DQ_1P_1]=\\frac{1}{2}$ ⋅ $\\frac{1}{2}$ ⋅ $\\frac{1}{3}$ . The second triangle has a base $DQ_2^{}$ equal to that of $P_1^{}Q_2^{}$ (see that $\\triangle DQ_2^{}P_1^{}$ ~ $\\triangle DCB$ ) and using the same similar triangle logic as with the first triangle, we find the area to be $[DQ_2P_2]=\\frac{1}{2}$ ⋅ $\\frac{1}{3}$ ⋅ $\\frac{1}{4}$ . If we continue and test the next few triangles, we will find that the sum of all $\\triangle DQ_i^{}P_i^{}$ is equal to \\[\\frac{1}{2} \\sum\\limits_{n=2}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n(n+1)}\\] or \\[\\frac{1}{2} \\sum\\limits_{n=2}^\\infty \\left(\\frac{1}{n} - \\frac{1}{n+1}\\right)\\]  This is known as a telescoping series because we can see that every term after the first $\\frac{1}{n}$ is going to cancel out. Thus, the summation is equal to $\\frac{1}{2}$ and after multiplying by the half out in front, we find that the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }\\frac{1}{4}}$ . Solution 2 (By mastermind.hk16) Note that $AD \\|\\ P_iQ_{i+1}\\  \\forall i \\in \\mathbb{N}$ . So $\\triangle ADQ_i \\sim \\triangle P_{i}Q_{i+1}Q_{i} \\ \\forall i \\in \\mathbb{N}$  Hence $\\frac{Q_iQ_{i+1}}{DQ_{i}}=\\frac{P_{i}Q_{i+1}}{AD} \\ \\ \\Longrightarrow DQ_i \\cdot P_iQ_{i+1}=Q_iQ_{i+1}$  We compute $\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty}DQ_i \\cdot P_iQ_{i+1}= \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty}Q_iQ_{i+1}=\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot DQ_1 =\\frac{1}{4}$ because $Q_i \\rightarrow D$ as $i \\rightarrow \\infty$ .  Solution 3 (By user0003) We plot the figure on a coordinate plane with $D=(0,0)$ and $A$ in the positive y-direction from the origin. If $Q_i=(k, 0)$ for some $k \\neq 0$ , then the line $AQ_i$ can be represented as $y=-\\frac{x}{k}+1$ . The intersection of this and $BD$ , which is the line $y=x$ , is \\[P_i = \\left(\\frac{k}{k+1}, \\frac{k}{k+1}\\right)\\] . As $Q_{i+1}$ is the projection of $P_i$ onto the x-axis, it lies at $\\left(\\frac{k}{k+1}, 0\\right)$ . We have thus established that moving from $Q_i$ to $Q_{i+1}$ is equivalent to the transformation $x \\rightarrow \\frac{x}{x+1}$ on the x-coordinate. The closed form of of the x-coordinate of $Q_i$ can be deduced to be $\\frac{1}{1+i}$ , which can be determined empirically and proven via induction on the initial case $Q_1 = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}, 0\\right)$ . Now \\[[\\Delta DQ_iP_i] = \\frac{1}{2}(DQ_i)(Q_{i+1}P_i) = \\frac{1}{2}(DQ_i)(DQ_{i+1}),\\]  suggesting that $[\\Delta DQ_iP_i]$ is equivalent to $\\frac{1}{2(i+1)(i+2)}$ . The sum of this from $i=1$ to $\\infty$ is a classic telescoping sequence as in Solution 1 and is equal to $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }\\frac{1}{4}}$ .\n",

Checking through all the factors of $999999$ and $9999$ that are less than $1000$ , we see that $n = 297$ is a solution, so the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B)}}$ . Note: $n = 27$ and $n = 3$ are both solutions, which invalidates this method. However, we need to examine all factors of $999999$ that are not factors of $99999$ , $999$ , or $99$ , or $9$ . Additionally, we need $n+6$ to be a factor of $9999$ but not $999$ , $99$ , or $9$ . Indeed, $297$ satisfies these requirements. We can see that $n=27$ and $n=3$ are not solutions by checking it in the requirements of the problem: $\\frac{1}{3}=0.3333\\dots$ , period 1, and $\\frac{1}{27}=0.037037\\dots$ , period 3. Thus, $n=297$ is the only answer. For anyone who wants more information about repeating decimals, visit: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repeating_decimal  Notice that the repeating fraction $0.\\overline{abcdef}$ can be represented as $\\frac{abcdef}{999999},$ and thereby, $n|999999.$ Also, notice that $0.\\overline{wxyz} = \\frac{wxyz}{9999},$ so $(n+6)|9999.$ However, we have to make some restrictions here. For instance, if $n|99999,$ then $\\frac{1}{n}$ could be expressed as $\\frac{a’b’c’d’e’}{99999} = .\\overline{a’b’c’d’e’}$ which cannot happen. Therefore, from this, we see that the smallest $m$ such that $n|\\underbrace{999\\cdots999}_{m \\text{ nines}}$ is $m = 6.$ Also, the smallest number $m$ such that $(n+6)|\\underbrace{999\\cdots999}_{m \\text{ nines}}$ is $m = 4$ by similar reasoning. Proceeding, we can factorize $9999 = 99 \\times 101,$ after which we see that $n+6$ must contain a prime factor of $101$ as it cannot divide $99$ but must divide $9999.$ However, $101$ is prime, so $101|(n+6)$ ! Looking at the answer choices, all of the intervals are less than $1000,$ so we know that (the minimum value of) $n+6$ is thereby either $101, 101 \\times 3,$ or $101 \\times 9.$ Testing, we see that $n+6 = 303$ gives $n = 297 = 3^3 \\times 11,$ which in fact is a divisor of $999 \\times 1001$ while not being a divisor of $999.$ Therefore, the answer is $\\boxed{\\text{(B)}}.$  ~ Professor-Mom\n",

Then for each prime power $p^k$ in the prime factorization of $N=\\frac{n}{77}$ , at least one of the prime factorizations of $(A,B,C,D)$ has $p^k$ , at least one has $p^0$ , and all must have $p^m$ with $0\\le m\\le k$ . Let $f(k)$ be the number of ordered quadruplets of integers $(m_1,m_2,m_3,m_4)$ such that $0\\le m_i\\le k$ for all $i$ , the largest is $k$ , and the smallest is $0$ . Then for the prime factorization $N=2^{k_2}3^{k_3}5^{k_5}\\ldots$ we must have $77000=f(k_2)f(k_3)f(k_5)\\ldots$ So let's take a look at the function $f(k)$ by counting the quadruplets we just mentioned. There are $14$ quadruplets which consist only of $0$ and $k$ . Then there are $36(k-1)$ quadruplets which include three different values, and $12(k-1)(k-2)$ with four. Thus $f(k)=14+12(k-1)(3+k-2)=14+12(k^2-1)$ and the first few values from $k=1$ onwards are \\[14,50,110,194,302,434,590,770,\\ldots\\] Straight away we notice that $14\\cdot 50\\cdot 110=77000$ , so the prime factorization of $N$ can use the exponents $1,2,3$ . To make it as small as possible, assign the larger exponents to smaller primes. The result is $N=2^33^25^1=360$ , so $n=360\\cdot 77=27720$ which is answer $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D)}}$ . Also, to get the above formula of $f(k)=12 k^2+2$ , we can also use the complementary counting by doing $(k+1)^4-k^4-k^4+(k-1)^4$ , while the first term $(k+1)^4$ is for the four integers to independently have $k+1$ choices each, with the second term indicating to subtract all the possibilities for the four integers to have values between $0$ and $k-1$ , and similarly the third term indicating to subtract all the possibilities for the four integers to have values between $1$ and $k$ , in the end the fourth term meaning the make up for the values between $1$ and $k-1$ .\n",

The characteristic polynomial of this linear recurrence is $x^2-x-2=0$ , which has roots $2$ and $-1$ . Therefore, $b_n=k_12^{n}+k_2(-1)^n$ for constants to be determined $k_1, k_2$ .  Using the fact that $b_0=0, b_1=1,$ we can solve a pair of linear equations for $k_1, k_2$ : $k_1+k_2=0$  $2k_1-k_2=1$ . Thus $k_1=\\frac{1}{3}$ , $k_2=-\\frac{1}{3}$ , and $b_n=\\frac{2^n-(-1)^n}{3}$ . Now, $a_1a_2\\cdots a_k=2^{\\frac{(b_1+b_2+\\cdots+b_k)}{19}}$ , so we are looking for the least value of $k$ so that $b_1+b_2+\\cdots+b_k \\equiv 0 \\pmod{19}$ . Note that we can multiply all $b_i$ by three for convenience, as the $b_i$ are always integers, and it does not affect divisibility by $19$ . Now, for all even $k$ the sum (adjusted by a factor of three) is $2^1+2^2+\\cdots+2^k=2^{k+1}-2$ . The smallest $k$ for which this is a multiple of $19$ is $k=18$ by Fermat's Little Theorem, as it is seen with further testing that $2$ is a primitive root $\\pmod{19}$ . Now, assume $k$ is odd. Then the sum (again adjusted by a factor of three) is $2^1+2^2+\\cdots+2^k+1=2^{k+1}-1$ . The smallest $k$ for which this is a multiple of $19$ is $k=17$ , by the same reasons. Thus, the minimal value of $k$ is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A) } 17}$ . Since the product $a_1a_2\\cdots a_k$ is an integer, it must be a power of $2$ , so the sum of the base- $2$ logarithms must be an integer. Multiply all of these logarithms by $19$ (to make them integers), so the sum must be a multiple of $19$ . The logarithms are $b_n = 19\\log_2 a_n$ . Using the recursion $b_0 = 0, b_1 = 1, b_n = b_{n-1}+2b_{n-2}$ (modulo $19$ to save calculation time), we get the sequence \\[0,1,1,3,5,11,2,5,9,0,-1,-1,-3,-5,-11,-2,-5,-9,0,\\dots\\] Listing the numbers out is expedited if you notice $b_{n+1}=2b_n+(-1)^n$ . The cycle repeats every $9+9=18$ terms. Notice that since $b_n+b_{n+9} \\equiv 0 \\pmod{19}$ , the first $18$ terms sum up to a multiple of $19$ . Since $b_{18}=0$ , we only need at most the first $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A)}\\ 17}$ terms to sum up to a multiple of $19$ , and this is the lowest answer choice. Note: To rigorously prove this is the smallest value, you will have to keep a running sum of the terms and check that it is never a multiple of $19$ before the $17$ th term. Like in Solution 2 , calculate the first few terms of the sequence, but also keep a running sum $c_n$ of the logarithms (not modulo $19$ here): \\[0,1,2,5,10,21,42,\\dots\\] Notice that $c_n=2c_{n-1}+1$ for odd $n$ and $c_n=2c_{n-1}$ for even $n$ . Since $2$ is relatively prime to $19$ , we can ignore even $n$ and calculate odd $n$ using $c_1 = 1, c_{n} = 4c_{n-2}+1$ (modulo $19$ ): \\[,1,,5,,2,,9,,-1,,-3,,8,,-5,,0,\\dots\\]  $c_n$ is first a multiple of $19$ at $n = \\boxed{\\textbf{(A)}\\ 17}$ . ~ emerald_block \n",

We want to find the radius of $C_4$ . We now invert the four circles. $C_1$ inverts to a line. Given that one point is on $\\Omega$ , and all points on $\\Omega$ invert to themselves, we know that the resulting line must intersect that intersection point. $C_2$ also inverts to a line. $C_2$ has radius $4$ , and since $\\Omega$ has radius of $6$ , the resulting line must be $\\frac{36}{4} = 9$ units away from $O$ . $C_3$ inverts to a circle. By observing the diagram, we note that $C_3'$ 's center must be on $\\overline{OC_3}$ and be between the two inverted lines, because $C_3$ is tangent to $C_1$ and $C_2$ (Remeber that tangency still holds in inverted diagrams). Therefore, we must have a circle with radius $\\frac{3}{2}$ that is $\\frac{15}{2}$ units from $O$ . [asy] size(10cm); path circle1 = Circle((3, 0), 3); path circle2 = Circle((2, 0), 2); path circle3 = Circle((5, 0), 1); pair P = (2,0)+(2+6/7)*dir(36.86989); path circle4 = Circle(P, 6/7); draw(circle1); draw(circle2); draw(circle3); draw(circle4); draw((0, 0)--(9, 0)); dot((2,0)); dot((5,0)); dot(P); dot((3, 0)); dot(origin); path inversion = arc((0,0), 6, -30, 30); draw(inversion, dashed); label(\"$\\Omega$\", (6, 0) * dir(30), NW); label(\"$C_1$\", (3, 0), N); label(\"$C_2$\", (2, 0), N); label(\"$C_3$\", (5, 0), N); label(\"$C_4$\", P, N); label(\"$O$\", origin, W); draw((6, 3)--(6, -3)); draw((9, 3)--(9, -3)); draw(Circle((15/2, 0), 3/2)); label(\"$C_1'$\", (6, 3), N); label(\"$C_2'$\", (9, 3), N); label(\"$C_3'$\", (15/2, 0), N); dot((15/2, 0)); [/asy]  Now, we invert $C_4$ . Note that $C_4$ is tangent to the three other original circles. So, in the inversion, $C_4'$ must be tangent to the two lines and  $C_3'$ . It is then quickly seen that $C_3'$ and $C_4'$ have the same radius: $\\frac{3}{2}$ . Now, we can determine the radius of $C_4$ using the formula $r = \\frac{k^2 \\cdot r'}{\\overline{OC_2}^2 - r'^2}$ . $k^2 = 36$ , and $r' = \\frac{3}{2}$ . $\\overline{OC}$ is just the distance from the center of the inverted circle to the center of inversion. The center of $C_4'$ is $3$ units above the center of $C_3'$ . Since $\\overline{OC_3'} = \\frac{15}{2}$ , we use Pythagoras to learn that $\\overline{OC_4'}^2 = \\left(\\frac{15}{2}\\right)^2 + 9$ .

      " Note that these $z$ such that $z^{24}=1$ are $e^{\\frac{ni\\pi}{12}}$ for integer $0\\leq n<24$ . So $z^6=e^{\\frac{ni\\pi}{2}}$  This is real if $\\frac{n}{2}\\in \\mathbb{Z} \\Leftrightarrow (n$ is even $)$ . Thus, the answer is the number of even $0\\leq n<24$ which is $\\boxed{(D)=\\ 12}$ . $z = \\sqrt[24]{1} = 1^{\\frac{1}{24}}$  By Euler's identity , $1 = e^{0 \\times i} = \\cos (0+2k\\pi) + i \\sin(0+2k\\pi)$ , where $k$ is an integer. Using De Moivre's Theorem , we have $z = 1^{\\frac{1}{24}} = {\\cos (\\frac{k\\pi}{12}) + i \\sin (\\frac{k\\pi}{12})}$ , where $0 \\leq k<24$ that produce $24$ unique results. Using De Moivre's Theorem again, we have $z^6 = {\\cos (\\frac{k\\pi}{2}) + i \\sin (\\frac{k\\pi}{2})}$  For $z^6$ to be real, $\\sin(\\frac{k\\pi}{2})$ has to equal $0$ to negate the imaginary component. This occurs whenever $\\frac{k\\pi}{2}$ is an integer multiple of $\\pi$ , requiring that $k$ is even. There are exactly $\\boxed{12}$ even values of $k$ on the interval $0 \\leq k<24$ , so the answer is $\\boxed{(D)}$ . From the start, recall from the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra that $z^{24} = 1$ must have $24$ solutions (and these must be distinct since the equation factors into $0 = (z-1)(z^{23} + z^{22} + z^{21}... + z + 1)$ ), or notice that the question is simply referring to the 24th roots of unity, of which we know there must be $24$ . Notice that $1 = z^{24} = (z^6)^4$ , so for any solution $z$ , $z^6$ will be one of the 4th roots of unity ( $1$ , $i$ , $-1$ , or $-i$ ). Then $6$ solutions $z$ will satisfy $z^6 = 1$ , $6$ will satisfy $z^6 = -1$ (and this is further justified by knowledge of the 6th roots of unity), so there must be $\\boxed{(D) \\: 12}$ such $z$ . Let $a\\in\\mathbb{R}$ and $a = z^6.$ We have \\[a^4 = 1 \\implies a = 1,-1.\\]  $z^6 = \\pm 1$ has 6 solutions for $1$ and $-1$ respectively, so $6+6=\\boxed{(D)\\ 12}.$  \\[\\] -svyn\n",

      " Note that $n\\equiv S(n)\\bmod 9$ , so $S(n+1)-S(n)\\equiv n+1-n = 1\\bmod 9$ . So, since $S(n)=1274\\equiv 5\\bmod 9$ , we have that $S(n+1)\\equiv 6\\bmod 9$ . The only one of the answer choices $\\equiv 6\\bmod 9$ is $\\boxed{(D)=\\ 1239}$ . One possible value of $S(n)$ would be $1275$ , but this is not any of the choices. Therefore, we know that $n$ ends in $9$ , and after adding $1$ , the last digit $9$ carries over, turning the last digit into $0$ . If the next digit is also a $9$ , this process repeats until we get to a non- $9$ digit. By the end, the sum of digits would decrease by $9$ multiplied by the number of carry-overs but increase by $1$ as a result of the final carrying over. Therefore, the result must be $9x-1$ less than original value of $S(n)$ , $1274$ , where $x$ is a positive integer. The only choice that satisfies this condition is $\\boxed{1239}$ , since $(1274-1239+1) \\bmod 9 = 0$ . The answer is $\\boxed{D}$ . Another way to solve this is to realize that if you continuously add the digits of the number $1274 (1 + 2 + 7 + 4 = 14, 1 + 4 = 5)$ , we get $5$ . Adding one to that, we get $6$ . So, if we assess each option to see which one attains $6$ , we would discover that $1239$ satisfies the requirement, because $1 + 2 + 3 + 9 = 15$ . $1 + 5 = 6$ . The answer is $\\boxed{D}$ . Note that a lot of numbers can have a sum of $1274$ , but what we use wishful thinking and want is some simple number $n$ where it is easy to compute the sum of the digits of $n+1$ . This number would consists of basically all digits $9$ , since when you add $1$ a lot of stuff will cancel out and end up at $0$ (ex: $399+1=400$ ). We see that the maximum number of $9$ s that can be in $1274$ is $141$ and we are left with a remainder of $5$ , so $n$ is in the form $99...9599...9$ . If we add $1$ to this number we will get $99...9600...0$ so this the sum of the digits of $n+1$ is congruent to $6 \\mod 9$ . The only answer choice that is equivalent to $6 \\mod 9$ is $1239$ , so our answer is $\\boxed{D}$ -srisainandan6 https://youtu.be/zfChnbMGLVQ?t=3996  ~ pi_is_3.14\n",

      " It is possible to solve this problem using elementary counting methods. This solution proceeds by a cleaner generating function. We note that $\\pm \\sqrt{2}i$ both lie on the imaginary axis and each of the $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{8}}(\\pm 1\\pm i)$ have length $\\frac{1}{2}$ and angle of odd multiples of $\\pi/4$ , i.e. $\\pi/4,3\\pi/4,5\\pi/4,7\\pi/4$ . When we draw these 6 complex numbers out on the complex plane, we get a crystal-looking thing. Note that the total number of ways to choose 12 complex numbers is $6^{12}$ . Now we count the number of good combinations. We first consider the lengths. When we multiply 12 complex numbers together, their magnitudes multiply. Suppose we have $n$ of the numbers $\\pm \\sqrt{2}i$ ; then we must have $\\left(\\sqrt{2}\\right)^n\\cdot\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{12-n}=1 \\Longrightarrow n=8$ . Having $n=8$ will take care of the length of the product; now we need to deal with the angle. We require $\\sum\\theta\\equiv\\pi \\mod 2\\pi$ . Letting $z$ be $e^{i\\pi/4}$ , we see that the angles we have available are $\\{z^1,z^2,z^3,z^5,z^6,z^7\\}$ , where we must choose exactly 8 angles from the set $\\{z^2,z^6\\}$ and exactly 4 from the set $\\{z^1,z^3,z^5,z^7\\}$ . If we found a good combination where we had $a_i$ of each angle $z^i$ , then the amount this would contribute to our count would be $\\binom{12}{4,8}\\cdot\\binom{8}{a_2,a_6}\\cdot\\binom{4}{a_1,a_3,a_5,a_7}$ . We want to add these all up. We proceed by generating functions. Consider \\[(t_2x^2+t_6x^6)^8(t_1x^1+t_3x^3+t_5x^5+t_7x^7)^4.\\] The expansion will be of the form $\\sum_i\\left(\\sum_{\\sum a=i} \\binom{8}{a_2,a_6}\\binom{4}{a_1,a_3,a_5,a_7}{t_1}^{a_1}{t_2}^{a_2}{t_3}^{a_3}{t_5}^{a_5}{t_6}^{a_6}{t_7}^{a_7}x^i \\right)$ . Note that if we reduced the powers of $x$ mod $8$ and fished out the coefficient of $x^4$ and plugged in $t_i=1\\ \\forall\\,i$ (and then multiplied by $\\binom{12}{4,8}$ ) then we would be done. Since plugging in $t_i=1$ doesn't affect the $x$ 's, we do that right away. The expression then becomes \\[x^{20}(1+x^4)^8(1+x^2+x^4+x^6)^4=x^{20}(1+x^4)^{12}(1+x^2)^4=x^4(1+x^4)^{12}(1+x^2)^4,\\] where the last equality is true because we are taking the powers of $x$ mod $8$ . Let $[x^n]f(x)$ denote the coefficient of $x^n$ in $f(x)$ . Note $[x^4] x^4(1+x^4)^{12}(1+x^2)^4=[x^0](1+x^4)^{12}(1+x^2)^4$ . We use the roots of unity filter, which states \\[\\text{terms of }f(x)\\text{ that have exponent congruent to }k\\text{ mod }n=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{m=1}^n \\frac{f(z^mx)}{z^{mk}},\\] where $z=e^{i\\pi/n}$ . In our case $k=0$ , so we only need to find the average of the $f(z^mx)$ 's. \\begin{align*} z^0 &\\Longrightarrow (1+x^4)^{12}(1+x^2)^4,\\\\ z^1 &\\Longrightarrow (1-x^4)^{12}(1+ix^2)^4,\\\\ z^2 &\\Longrightarrow (1+x^4)^{12}(1-x^2)^4,\\\\ z^3 &\\Longrightarrow (1-x^4)^{12}(1-ix^2)^4,\\\\ z^4 &\\Longrightarrow (1+x^4)^{12}(1+x^2)^4,\\\\ z^5 &\\Longrightarrow (1-x^4)^{12}(1+ix^2)^4,\\\\ z^6 &\\Longrightarrow (1+x^4)^{12}(1-x^2)^4,\\\\ z^7 &\\Longrightarrow (1-x^4)^{12}(1-ix^2)^4. \\end{align*} We plug in $x=1$ and take the average to find the sum of all coefficients of $x^{\\text{multiple of 8}}$ . Plugging in $x=1$ makes all of the above zero except for $z^0$ and $z^4$ . Averaging, we get $2^{14}$ . Now the answer is simply \\[\\frac{\\binom{12}{4,8}}{6^{12}}\\cdot 2^{14}=\\boxed{\\textbf{(E)} ~\\frac{2^2\\cdot 5\\cdot 11}{3^{10}}}.\\]  By changing $z_1$ to $-z_1$ , we can give a bijection between cases where $P=-1$ and cases where $P=1$ , so we'll just find the probability that $P=\\pm 1$ and divide by $2$ in the end. Multiplying the hexagon's vertices by $i$ doesn't change $P$ , and switching any $z_j$ with $-z_j$ doesn't change the property $P=\\pm 1$ , so the probability that $P=\\pm1$ remains the same if we only select our $z_j$ 's at random from \\[\\left\\{a= \\sqrt 2,\\quad b=\\frac1{\\sqrt{8}}(1+i),\\quad c=\\frac1{\\sqrt{8}}(1-i)\\right\\}.\\] Since $|a|=\\sqrt2$ and $|b|=|c|=\\frac12$ , we must choose $a$ exactly $8$ times to make $|P|=1$ . To ensure $P$ is real, we must either choose $b$  $4$ times, $c$  $4$ times, or both $b$ and $c$  $2$ times. This gives us a total of \\[2\\binom{12}{4}+\\binom{12}{2}\\binom{10}{2}=(12\\cdot 11\\cdot 10\\cdot 9)\\left(\\frac1{12}+\\frac14\\right)=(2^3\\cdot 3^3\\cdot 5\\cdot 11)\\frac13\\] good sequences $z_1,\\dots,z_{12}$ , and hence the final result is \\[\\frac12\\cdot \\frac{2^3\\cdot 3^2\\cdot 5\\cdot 11}{3^{12}}=\\boxed{\\textbf{(E)} ~\\frac{2^2\\cdot 5\\cdot 11}{3^{10}}}.\\]  We use generating functions and a roots of unity filter.\n",
      "Notice that all values in $V$ are eighth roots of unity multiplied by a constant.  Let $x$ be a primitive eighth root of unity ( $e^{\\frac{i\\pi}{4}}$ ).  The numbers in $V$ are then $\\left \\{ \\frac{x}{2},x^2\\sqrt2,\\frac{x^3}{2},\\frac{x^5}{2},x^6\\sqrt2,\\frac{x^7}{2} \\right\\}$ .  To have $P=-1$ , we must have that $|P|=1$ , so eight of the $(z_i)$ must belong to \\[\\left \\{ x^2\\sqrt2,x^6\\sqrt2 \\right\\}\\] and the other four must belong to \\[\\left \\{ \\frac{x}{2},\\frac{x^3}{2},\\frac{x^5}{2},\\frac{x^7}{2} \\right\\}\\] So, we write the generating function \\[\\left (x^2 +x^6 \\right )^8 \\left (x+x^3+x^5+x^7 \\right )^4\\] to describe the product.  Note that this assumes that the $(z_i)$ that belong to $\\left \\{ x^2\\sqrt2,x^6\\sqrt2 \\right\\}$ come first, so we will need to multiply by $\\binom{12}{4}$ at the end.  We now apply a roots of unity filter to find the sum of the coefficients of the exponents that are $4\\pmod{8}$ , or equivalently the coefficients of the powers that are multiples of $8$ of the following function: \\[P(x)=\\left (x^2 +x^6 \\right )^8 \\left (x+x^3+x^5+x^7 \\right )^4x^4\\] Let $\\zeta=e^{\\frac{i\\pi}{4}}$ .  We are looking for $\\frac{P(1)+P(\\zeta)+P(\\zeta^2)+P(\\zeta^3)+P(\\zeta^4)+P(\\zeta^5)+P(\\zeta^6)+P(\\zeta^7)}{8}$ . $P(1)=P(-1)=2^{16}$ , and all of the rest are equal to $0$ .  So, we get an answer of $\\frac{2^{16}+2^{16}}{8\\cdot 6^{12}}=\\frac{2^{14}}{6^{12}}=\\frac{2^2}{3^{10}}$ .  But wait!  We need to multiply by $\\binom{12}{4} =\\frac{12\\cdot11\\cdot10\\cdot9}{4\\cdot3\\cdot3\\cdot1}$ $=5\\cdot9\\cdot11$ .  So, the answer is $\\boxed{\\text{\\textbf{(E) }} \\frac{2^2\\cdot5\\cdot11}{3^{10}} }$  We can write the points in polar form $(r, \\theta)$ as \\[V = \\left\\{ \\left(\\sqrt{2}, \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right), \\left(\\sqrt{2}, \\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\right), \\left(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right), \\left(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{3\\pi}{4}\\right), \\left(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{5\\pi}{4}\\right), \\left(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{7\\pi}{4}\\right)\\right\\}.\\] Note that when multiplying complex numbers, the $r$ 's multiply and the $\\theta$ 's add, and since $-1 = (1, \\pi),$ we need $8$ complex numbers with $r = \\sqrt{2} = 2^{0.5}$ and $4$ with $r = \\frac{1}{2} = 2^{-1}.$ By binomial distribution, the probability of this occurring is $\\dbinom{12}{4} \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^8 \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^4.$ For the $\\theta$ part, note that $\\frac{4\\theta}{\\pi}$ must be congruent to $4 \\mod 8,$ and by using simple symmetry, the probability of the aforementioned occurring is $\\frac{1}{4}.$ This is since $2a + 6b$ is even for all $a + b =8,$ and the number of ordered quadruples $(a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4)$ such that $a_i \\in \\{1, 3, 5, 7\\}$ for all $1 \\leq i \\leq 4$ and $a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 \\equiv 2k \\mod 8$ is the same for all $1 \\leq k \\leq 4,$ again by using symmetry. Thus, our probability is \\[\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^8 \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^4 \\dbinom{12}{4} = \\frac{2^2}{3^{12}} \\dbinom{12}{4} = \\boxed{\\textbf{(E)} ~\\frac{2^2\\cdot 5\\cdot 11}{3^{10}}}\\]  -fidgetboss_4000 The absolute value of the first two complex numbers is $\\sqrt{2}$ while the absolute value of the latter four is $\\frac12$ . For the absolute value of the product to be $1$ , we need $8$ elements with absolute value $\\sqrt{2}$ and $4$ elements with absolute value of $\\frac12$ . We pick $8$ elements from $A = \\left\\{   \\sqrt{2}i,-\\sqrt{2}i\\right\\}$ and $4$ elements from $B = \\left\\{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{8}}(1+i),\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{8}}(-1+i),\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{8}}(1-i),\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{8}}(-1-i) \\right\\}$ . We also need to choose which $8$ of $z_j$ will be chosen from $A$ which gives us ${12 \\choose 8} \\cdot 2^8 \\cdot 4^4$ cases. However, suppose we have chosen $11$ elements and we need to choose one more element from $B$ . The product of these $11$ elements can have any of these values: $\\left\\{ 2\\mathrm{cis}(\\frac{\\pi}{4}), 2\\mathrm{cis}(\\frac{3\\pi}{4}), 2\\mathrm{cis}(\\frac{5\\pi}{4}), 2\\mathrm{cis}(\\frac{7\\pi}{4}), \\right\\}$ . For either of these values, there is just one value of $z_{12} \\in B$ such that $P = -1$ so we must divide by $4$ which gives ${12 \\choose 8} \\cdot 2^8 \\cdot 4^3$ cases. Because there are $6^{12}$ ways to pick any $12$ elements, our probability is simply $\\frac{{12 \\choose 8} \\cdot 2^8 \\cdot 4^3}{6^{12}} = \\frac{2^2}{3^{12}} {12 \\choose 8} = \\boxed{\\text{\\textbf{(E) }} \\frac{2^2\\cdot5\\cdot11}{3^{10}} }$  ~Zeric Let $a = \\sqrt{2}i$ , $b = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{8}}(1+i)$ , $c = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{8}}(-1+i)$ . $\\bar{a} = -\\sqrt{2}i$ , $\\bar{b} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{8}}(1-i)$ , $\\bar{c} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{8}}(-1-i)$  The magnitude of $\\left\\{ a, \\bar{a} \\right\\}$ is $\\sqrt{2}$ , while the magnitude of $\\left\\{ b, \\bar{b}, c, \\bar{c} \\right\\}$ is $\\frac12$ .

We can get the equation $\\frac{a}{b} = \\frac{b}{\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}$ . Cross-multiplying, we get $a\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = b^2$ . Squaring both sides of the equation, we get $a^2 (a^2 + b^2) = b^4$ , which simplifies to $a^4 + a^2b^2 - b^4 = 0$ . Solving for a quadratic in $a^2$ , using the quadratic formula we get $a^2 = \\frac{-b^2 \\pm \\sqrt{5b^4}}{2}$ which gives us $\\frac{a^2}{b^2} = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{5}}{2}$ .

Solution by: vedadehhc Solution by HydroQuantum Let the short side of the rectangle be $a$ and let the long side of the rectangle be $b$ .

Their intersection points are where these two equations gain equality. The two points lie on the line with the equation $(x+10)^2+(y+4)^2-169=(x-3)^2+(y-9)^2-65$ .

      " Case 1: monotonous numbers with digits in ascending order There are $\\sum_{n=1}^{9} \\binom{9}{n}$ ways to choose n digits from the digits 1 to 9. For each of these ways, we can generate exactly one monotonous number by ordering the chosen digits in ascending order. Note that 0 is not included since it will always be a leading digit and that is not allowed. Also, $\\emptyset$ (the empty set) isn't included because it doesn't generate a number. The sum is equivalent to $\\sum_{n=0}^{9} \\binom{9}{n} -\\binom{9}{0} = 2^9 - 1 = 511.$  Case 2: monotonous numbers with digits in descending order There are $\\sum_{n=1}^{10} \\binom{10}{n}$ ways to choose n digits from the digits 0 to 9. For each of these ways, we can generate exactly one monotonous number by ordering the chosen digits in descending order. Note that 0 is included since we are allowed to end numbers with zeros. However, $\\emptyset$ (the empty set) still isn't included because it doesn't generate a number. The sum is equivalent to $\\sum_{n=0}^{10} \\binom{10}{n} -\\binom{10}{0} = 2^{10} - 1 = 1023.$ We discard the number 0 since it is not positive. Thus there are $1022$ here. Since the 1-digit numbers 1 to 9 satisfy both case 1 and case 2, we have overcounted by 9. Thus there are $511+1022-9=\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }  1524}$ monotonous numbers. Like Solution 1, divide the problem into an increasing and decreasing case: $\\bullet$ Case 1: Monotonous numbers with digits in ascending order. Arrange the digits 1 through 9 in increasing order, and exclude 0 because a positive integer cannot begin with 0. To get a monotonous number, we can either include or exclude each of the remaining 9 digits, and there are $2^9 = 512$ ways to do this. However, we cannot exclude every digit at once, so we subtract 1 to get $512-1=511$ monotonous numbers for this case. $\\bullet$ Case 2: Monotonous numbers with digits in descending order. This time, we arrange all 10 digits in decreasing order and repeat the process to find $2^{10} = 1024$ ways to include or exclude each digit. We cannot exclude every digit at once, and we cannot include only 0, so we subtract 2 to get $1024-2=1022$ monotonous numbers for this case. At this point, we have counted all of the single-digit monotonous numbers twice, so we must subtract 9 from our total. Thus our final answer is $511+1022-9 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(B) } 1524}$ . Unlike the first two solutions, we can do our casework based off of whether or not the number contains a $0$ . If it does, then we know the $0$ must be the last digit in the number (and hence, the number has to be decreasing). Because $0$ is not positive, $0$ is not monotonous. So, we need to pick at least $1$ number in the set $[1, 9].$ After choosing our numbers, there will be just $1$ way to arrange them so that the overall number is monotonous. In total, each of the $9$ digits can either be in the monotonous number or not, yielding $2^9 = 512$ total solutions. However, we said earlier that $0$ cannot be by itself so we have to subtract out the case in which we picked none of the numbers $1-9$ . So, this case gives us $511$ . Onto the second case, if there are no $0$ s, then the number can either be arranged in ascending order or in descending order. So, for each selection of the digits $1- 9$ , there are $2$ solutions. This gives \\[2 \\cdot (2^9 - 1) = 2 \\cdot 511 = 1022\\] possibilities. Note that we subtracted out the $1$ because we cannot choose none of the numbers. However, realize that if we pick just $1$ digit, then there is only $1$ arrangement. We cannot put a single digit in both ascending and descending order. So, we must subtract out $9$ from there (because there are $9$ possible ways to select one number and for each case, we overcounted by $1$ ). All in all, that gives $511 + 1022 - 9 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(B)  } 1524}$ monotonous numbers. Let $n$ be the number of digits of a monotonous number. Notice for an increasing monotonous number with $n \\ge 2$ , we can obtain 2 more monotonous numbers that are decreasing by reversing its digits and adding a $0$ to the end of the reversed digits. Whenever $n$ digits are chosen, the order is fixed. There are $\\binom{9}{n}$ ways to obtain an increasing monotonous number with $n$ digits. So, there are $3\\cdot \\sum_{n=2}^{9} \\binom{9}{n}$ monotonous numbers when $n \\ge 2$ . When $n=1$ , there is no reverse but we could add $0$ to the end, so there are $2 \\cdot \\binom{9}{1}$ monotonous numbers. The answer is: $3\\cdot \\sum_{n=2}^{9} \\binom{9}{n} + 2 \\cdot \\binom{9}{1}$  $=3\\cdot \\sum_{n=1}^{9} \\binom{9}{n}  -  \\binom{9}{1}$  $=3\\cdot \\left( \\sum_{n=0}^{9} \\binom{9}{n} - \\binom{9}{0} \\right) -  \\binom{9}{1}$  $= 3 \\cdot (2^9-1) - 9$  $=\\boxed{\\textbf{(B)  } 1524}$  ~ isabelchen  We have 2 cases. Case 1: Ascending order  We can set up a 1-1 Correspondence. For any subset of all the digits $1$ to $9$ ( $0$ cannot be a digit for ascending order), we can always rearrange them into an ascending monotonous number. Therefore, the number of subsets of the integers $1$ to $9$ is equivalent to the number of ascending integers. So, $2^9=512$ . However, the empty set ( $\\emptyset$ ) is not an integer, so we must subtract 1. Thus, $512-1=511$ . Case 2: Descending order  Similarly, any subset of the digits $0$ to $9$ can be rearranged into a descending monotonous number. So, $2^{10}=1024$ . However, $\\emptyset$ and $0$ are not positive integers, so we must subtract 2. Thus, $1024-2=1022$ .  We have covered all the cases. We add $511$ to $1022$ , giving us $1533$ . So now we just innocently go ahead and choose $\\textbf{(C) } 1533$ as our answer, right? No! We overcounted the $9$  single-digit integers . The answer is actually $1533-9=\\boxed{\\textbf{(B)  } 1524}$ . ~MrThinker\n",

We also know that since $BB'$ are collinear, as are the others, angle $C'BB'$ is $180 - 60$ , which is $120$ degrees. Because that angle is an included angle, we get the area of all three congruent triangle's are $\\frac{12x^2\\sin120}{2} \\cdot 3$ . Simplifying that yields $\\frac{36x^2\\sqrt{3}}{4}$ . Adding that to the $[ABC]$ yields $\\frac{37x^2\\sqrt{3}}{4}$ . From this, we can compare the ratios by canceling everything out except for the $37$ , so the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) }37}$  ~Solution by EricShi1685 Solution by HydroQuantum Let $AB=BC=CA=x$ . Recall The Law of Cosines. Letting $A'B'=B'C'=C'A'=y$ , \\[y^2=(3x)^2+(x+3x)^2-2(3x)(x+3x)(\\cos 120) =\\]  \\[(3x)^2+(4x)^2-2(3x)(4x)(\\cos 120)=9x^2+16x^2-24x(\\cos 120)=25x^2+12x^2=37x^2.\\] Since both $\\triangle ABC$ and $\\triangle A'B'C'$ are both equilateral triangles, they must be similar due to $AA$ similarity. This means that $\\frac{A'B'}{AB}$  $=$  $\\frac{B'C'}{BC}$  $=$  $\\frac{C'A'}{CA}$  $=$  $\\frac{[\\triangle A'B'C']}{[\\triangle ABC]}$  $=$  $\\frac{37}{1}$ . Therefore, our answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) }37}$ . Note that the height and base of $\\triangle A'CC'$ are respectively 4 times and 3 times that of $\\triangle ABC$ . Therefore the area of $\\triangle A'CC'$ is 12 times that of $\\triangle ABC$ . By symmetry, $\\triangle A'CC' \\cong \\triangle B'AA' \\cong \\triangle C'BB'$ . Adding the areas of these three triangles and $\\triangle ABC$ for the total area of $\\triangle A'B'C'$ gives a ratio of $(12 + 12 + 12 + 1) : 1$ , or $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) } 37}$ . First we note that $A'B'C'\\sim ABC$ due to symmetry. WLOG, let $B = (0, 0)$ and $AB = 1$ Therefore, $C = (1, 0), A = \\frac{1}{2}, \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)$ . Using the condition that $CC' = 3$ , we get $C' = (4, 0)$ and $B' = \\left(\\frac{-3}{2}, \\frac{-3\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)$ . It is easy to check that $B'C' = \\sqrt{37}$ . Since the area ratios of two similar figures is the square of the ratio of their lengths, the ratio is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) } 37}$  Solution by mathwiz0803  Note that angle $C'BB'$ is $120$ °, as it is supplementary to the equilateral triangle. Then, using area $= \\frac{1}{2}ab\\sin\\theta$ and letting side $AB = 1$ for ease, we get: $4\\cdot3\\cdot\\frac{\\sin120}{2} = 3\\sqrt{3}$ as the area of $C'BB'$ . Then, the area of $ABC$ is $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}$ , so the ratio is $\\frac{3(3\\sqrt{3})+\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}}{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}} = \\boxed{\\textbf{(E) } 37}$  Solution by Aadileo\n",

      " We can consider a factor of $21!$ to be odd if it does not contain a $2$ ; hence, finding the exponent of $2$ in the prime factorization of $21!$ will help us find our answer. We can start off with all multiples of $2$ up to $21$ , which is $10$ . Then, we find multiples of $4$ , which is $5$ . Next, we look at multiples of $8$ , of which there are $2$ . Finally, we know there is only one multiple of $16$ in the set of positive integers up to $21$ . Now, we can add all of these to get $10+5+2+1=18$ . We know that, in the prime factorization of $21!$ , we have $2^{18}$ , and the only way to have an odd number is if there is not a $2$ in that number's prime factorization. This only happens with $2^{0}$ , which is only one of the 19 different exponents of 2 we could have (of which having each exponent is equally likely). Hence, we have $\\boxed{\\text{(B)} \\dfrac{1}{19}}.$  Solution by: armang32324 If $21!$ prime factorizes into $p$ prime factors with exponents $e_1$ through $e_k$ , then the product of the sums of each of these exponents plus $1$ should be over $60,000$ . If $e_2$ is the exponent of $2$ in the prime factorization of 21!, then we can find the number of odd factors of $21!$ by dividing the total by $e_2+1$ . Then, the number of odd divisors over total divisors is $\\dfrac{1}{e_2+1}$ . We can find $e_2$ easily using Legendre's, so our final answer is $\\dfrac{1}{10 + 5 + 2 + 1+1} = \\boxed{\\text{(B)} \\dfrac{1}{19}}.$  ~ icecreamrolls8 If a factor of $21!$ is odd, that means it contains no factors of $2$ . We can find the number of factors of two in $21!$ by counting the number multiples of $2$ , $4$ , $8$ , and $16$ that are less than or equal to $21$ (Legendre's Formula). After some quick counting we find that this number is $10+5+2+1 = 18$ . If the prime factorization of $21!$ has $18$ factors of $2$ , there are $19$ choices for each divisor for how many factors of $2$ should be included ( $0$ to $18$ inclusive). The probability that a randomly chosen factor is odd is the same as if the number of factors of $2$ is $0$ which is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B)}\\frac{1}{19}}$ . Solution by: vedadehhc We can write $21!$ as its prime factorization: \\[21!=2^{18}\\times3^9\\times5^4\\times7^3\\times11\\times13\\times17\\times19\\]  Each exponent of these prime numbers are one less than the number of factors at play here. This makes sense; $2^{18}$ is going to have $19$ factors: $2^0, 2^1, 2^2,...\\text{ }2^{18}$ , and the other exponents will behave identically. In other words, $21!$ has $(18+1)(9+1)(4+1)(3+1)(1+1)(1+1)(1+1)(1+1)$ factors. We are looking for the probability that a randomly chosen factor of $21!$ will be odd--numbers that do not contain multiples of $2$ as factors. From our earlier observation, the only factors of $21!$ that are even are ones with at least one multiplier of $2$ , so our probability of finding an odd factor becomes the following: \\[P(\\text{odd})=\\dfrac{\\text{number of odd factors}}{\\text{number of all factors}}=\\dfrac{(9+1)(4+1)(3+1)(1+1)(1+1)(1+1)(1+1)}{(18+1)(9+1)(4+1)(3+1)(1+1)(1+1)(1+1)(1+1)}=\\dfrac{1}{(18+1)}=\\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{19}}\\]  Solution submitted by David Kim  https://youtu.be/ZLHNTSIcGM8  -MistyMathMusic\n",

We know that $x\\equiv 0 \\pmod {9}$ and $x\\equiv 4 \\pmod {5}$ , so by the Chinese remainder theorem, since $9(-1)\\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$ , $x\\equiv 5(0)+9(-1)(4) \\pmod {5\\cdot 9}$ , or $x\\equiv -36 \\equiv 9 \\pmod {45}$ . So the answer is $\\boxed {\\textbf {(C)}}$ . We know that this number is divisible by $9$ because the sum of the digits is $270$ , which is divisible by $9$ . If we subtracted $9$ from the integer we would get $1234 \\cdots 4335$ , which is also divisible by $5$ and by $45$ . Thus the remainder is $9$ , or $\\boxed{\\textbf{C}}$ . To find the sum of digits of our number, we break it up into $5$ cases, starting with $0$ , $1$ , $2$ , $3$ , or $4$ .

We notice that the number ends in \" $4$ \", which is $9$ more than a multiple of $5$ . Thus if we subtracted $9$ from our number it would be divisible by $5$ , and $5\\cdot 9 = 45$ .

      " Let us simplify the problem. Since all of Isabella's test scores can be expressed as the sum of $90$ and an integer between $1$ and $10$ , we rewrite the problem into receiving scores between $1$ and $10$ . Later, we can add $90$ to her score to obtain the real answer. From this point of view, the problem states that Isabella's score on the seventh test was $5$ . We note that Isabella received $7$ integer scores out of $1$ to $10$ . Since $5$ is already given as the seventh test score, the possible scores for Isabella on the other six tests are $S={1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9,10}$ . The average score for the seven tests must be an integer. In other words, six distinct integers must be picked from set $S$ above, and their sum with $5$ must be a multiple of $7$ . The interval containing the possible sums of the six numbers in S are from $1 +2+3+4+6+7=23$ to $4+6+7+8+9+10=44$ . We must now find multiples of $7$ from the interval $23+5 = 28$ to $44+5=49$ . There are four possibilities: $28$ , $35$ , $42$ , $49$ .\n",
      "However, we also note that the sum of the six numbers (besides $5$ ) must be a multiple of $6$ as well. Thus, $35$ is the only valid choice.(The six numbers sum to $30$ .) Thus the sum of the six numbers equals to $30$ . We apply the logic above in a similar way for the sum of the scores from the first test to the fifth test. The sum must be a multiple of $5$ . The possible interval is from $1+2+3+4+6=16$ to $6+7+8+9+10=40$ . Since the sum of the five scores must be less than $30$ , the only possibilities are $20$ and $25$ . However, we notice that $25$ does not work because the seventh score turns out to be $5$ from the calculation. Therefore, the sum of Isabella's scores from test $1$ to $5$ is $20$ . Therefore, her score on the sixth test is $10$ .\n",
      "Our final answer is $10+90=  \\boxed{\\textbf{(E) }100}$ . Let $n$ be Isabella's average after $6$ tests. $6n+95 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}$ , so $n \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7}$ . The only integer between $90$ and $100$ that satisfies this condition is $95$ . Let $m$ be Isabella's average after $5$ tests, and let $a$ be her sixth test score. $5m+a= 6\\cdot95 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$ , so $a$ is a multiple of $5$ . Since $100$ is the only choice that is a multiple of $5$ , the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) }100}$ . Let $T$ be the total sum of Isabella's first five test scores, and let $S$ be her score on the sixth test. It follows that $T\\equiv 0\\pmod {5}$ , $T+S\\equiv 0\\pmod {6}$ , and $T+S+95\\equiv 0\\pmod {7}$ , since at each step, her average score was an integer. Using the last equivalence, $T+S\\equiv -95\\equiv 3\\pmod{7}$ , so we have a system of equivalences for $T+S$ . Solving this using the Chinese Remainder Theorem, we get $T+S\\equiv (0)(7)(1)+(3)(6)(-1) \\equiv -18 \\equiv 24 \\pmod{42}$ . Now let's put a bound on $T$ . Using the given information that each test score was a distinct integer from $91$ to $100$ inclusive and that the seventh score was 95, we get $91+92+93+94+96\\leq T\\leq 100+99+98+97+96$ . Since $T\\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$ , we get $T=470,475,480,485,490$ . Therefore, $T\\equiv 8,13,18,23,28\\pmod{42}$  The last preparation step will involve calculating all the possible test scores $\\pmod {42}$ . Here they are: $91\\equiv 7\\pmod{42},92\\equiv 8\\pmod{42},93\\equiv 9\\pmod{42},94\\equiv 10\\pmod{42},95\\equiv 11\\pmod{42},96\\equiv 12\\pmod{42},97\\equiv 13\\pmod{42},98\\equiv 14\\pmod{42},99\\equiv 15\\pmod{42},100\\equiv 16\\pmod{42}$ . This means that $S\\equiv 7,8,9,10,12,13,14,15,16\\pmod{42}$ . Note that $11$ is not in the previous list because it corresponds to a score of $95$ , which we cannot have. We must have $T+S\\equiv 24\\pmod{42}$ , and using the possible values we found for $T$ and $S$ , the only two that sum to $24$ are $T\\equiv 8\\pmod{42}$ and $S\\equiv 16\\pmod{42}$ . This corresponds to an $S$ value of $100$ , so the answer is $\\boxed{\\bold{(E)} 100}$ . We know that Isabella's score on the 7th test is 95, and we work backwards. Let $a_n$ denote the average of the first $n$ scores. We are given that all $a_n$ are integers. If the $a_6$ is different from the $a_7$ , then the last score must be a multiple of 7 away from $a_6$ . However, $95-7=88$ and $95+7=102$ clearly cannot be $a_6$ since they are outside the range of 91 to 100. Thus, $a_6$ must be 95. Additionally, $a_5$ cannot be 95 since that would mean the sixth score is 95, which isn't possible since scores can't repeat (also, it's not an answer choice). Intuitively, $a_5$ should be close to 95 due to the constraint on the range of scores. We can try 94 and 96 for $a_5$ . Again, the sixth score must be a multiple of 6 (preferably only one multiple) away from $a_5$ . The only one that works is $94+6=100$ , and we can check that the rest don't work since they exceed the range. The answer is $\\boxed{\\bold{(E)} 100}$ . - Lingjun :) Say the sum of the first 6 scores is $n$ . Then, we know that $n + 95 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}$ . Thus, $n \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7}$ . Additionally, since the average of these 6 scores was an integer, we know that $n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{6}$ . We find that the smallest $n$ to satisfy both of these inequalities is 24 (series below). \\[3, 10, 17, 24, ...\\] To get to the next one, we have to add $6 \\cdot 7 = 42$ so as not to ruin the moduli. Next, we know that $n$ is between $91 \\cdot 6 = 546$ and $100 \\cdot 6 = 600$ . It can't take on either value as all the scores have to be different. Now, we calculate the first $n$ that satisfies both moduli equations: \\[546 < 42 + 24x\\]  \\[91 < 7 + 4x\\]  \\[84 < 4x\\]  \\[21 < x\\]  $x = 22$ works while $x = 23$ does not (as it hits the upper limit of 600), and we find that $n = 42 + 24 \\cdot 22 = 570$ . So, the sum of the first 6 scores is 570. We also know that the sum of the first 5 scores is a multiple of 5. Since $5~\\mid~570$ , the 6th score must be a multiple of 5. 95 is taken, so the only possibility $\\boxed{\\bold{(E)} 100}$ .\n",

Then if 3rd = DA or CD, the 4th is forced to be CD or DA respectively, completing a transaction \"cycle\" Example 2.2: suppose 2nd = BC. Then if 3rd = AB or BC, the 4th is forced to be BC or AB respectively.

Then, for the 3th transaction, there are only 2 possible options (namely, to reverse one of the previous transactions). Of course, the final transaction is forced. Here, we have $4\\cdot 2\\cdot 1 = 8$ good options. Case 4 (AB again): The 2nd transaction is AB (same as 1st). This forces the later transactions to both be BA. Here we have 1 good option.

This will mean $15\\cdot 24 = 360$ ways for the first case. $\\textbf{Case 2}$ : Two same cycles of $2$ : There are $\\binom{4}{2}$ to choose the two people, multiplying by $\\binom{4}{2}$ for the number of orderings of the four transactions. Thus, $6\\cdot 6 = 36$ ways for this case. $\\textbf{Case 3}$ : One cycle of $4$ : We choose what goes in front of $A$ (whom $A$ gives a coin to) in $3$ ways, and what goes before $A$ (whom gives a coin to $A$ ) in $2$ ways. The remaining two transactions immediately get fixed after that. Again, there are $4! = 24$ ways to order the four transactions, giving $2\\cdot 3\\cdot 24 = 144$ ways for this case.

Notice that after the first round, $(3,5,4,4)$ is the only possible arrangement. Also, notice that the arrangement after the third round also has to be $(3,5,4,4)$ for the arrangement at the end of the fourth round to return to $(4,4,4,4)$ . The probability of $(4,4,4,4)$ occurring after $(3,5,4,4)$ is $\\frac{1}{12}$  After the arrangement $(3,5,4,4)$ , there are $12$ permutations that are $6$ different arrangements, they are: \\begin{align*} (2,6,4,4) \\text{ occurs once} \\quad & (4,4,4,4) \\text{ occurs once} \\quad & (2,5,5,4) \\text{ occurs twice}\\\\ (4,5,3,4) \\text{ occurs 4 times} \\quad & (3,6,3,4) \\text{ occurs twice} \\quad & (3,5,3,5) \\text{ occurs twice}\\\\ \\end{align*}  Therefore, we can create $6$ cases and calculate the probability of each case occurring.

      " First, we can define $f(x) = a(x-2)(x-3)(x-4) +x^2$ , which contains points $A$ , $B$ , and $C$ . Now we find that lines $AB$ , $AC$ , and $BC$ are defined by the equations $y = 5x - 6$ , $y= 6x-8$ , and $y=7x-12$ respectively. Since we want to find the $x$ -coordinates of the intersections of these lines and $f(x)$ , we set each of them to $f(x)$ , and synthetically divide by the solutions we already know exist (eg. if we were looking at line $AB$ , we would synthetically divide by the solutions $x=2$ and $x=3$ , because we already know $AB$ intersects the graph at $A$ and $B$ , which have $x$ -coordinates of $2$ and $3$ ). After completing this process on all three lines, we get that the $x$ -coordinates of $D$ , $E$ , and $F$ are $\\frac{4a-1}{a}$ , $\\frac{3a-1}{a}$ , and $\\frac{2a-1}{a}$ respectively. Adding these together, we get $\\frac{9a-3}{a} = 24$ which gives us $a = -\\frac{1}{5}$ . Substituting this back into the original equation, we get $f(x) = -\\frac{1}{5}(x-2)(x-3)(x-4) + x^2$ , and $f(0) = -\\frac{1}{5}(-2)(-3)(-4) + 0 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(D)}\\frac{24}{5}}$  Solution by vedadehhc $\\boxed{\\textbf{No need to find the equations for the lines, really.}}$ First of all, $f(x) = a(x-2)(x-3)(x-4) +x^2$ . Let's say the line $AB$ is $y=bx+c$ , and $x_1$ is the $x$ coordinate of the third intersection, then $2$ , $3$ , and $x_1$ are the three roots of $f(x) - bx-c$ . The values of $b$ and $c$ have no effect on the sum of the 3 roots, because the coefficient of the $x^2$ term is always $-9a+1$ . So we have \\[\\frac{9a-1}{a} = 2 + 3 + x_1= 3 + 4 + x_2 = 2 + 4 + x_3\\] Adding all three equations up, we get \\[3\\left(\\frac{9a-1}{a}\\right) = 18 + x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 18 + 24\\] Solving this equation, we get $a = -\\frac{1}{5}$ .

Therefore the area of the trapezoid is $40-16=\\boxed{24}$ . You can see that we can create a \"stack\" of 5 triangles congruent to the 7 small triangles shown here, arranged in a row above those 7, whose total area would be 5. Similarly, we can create another row of 3, and finally 1 more at the top, as follows. We know this cumulative area will be $7+5+3+1=16$ , so to find the area of such trapezoid $BCED$ , we just take $40-16=\\boxed{24}$ , like so. The combined area of the small triangles is $7$ , and from the fact that each small triangle has an area of $1$ , we can deduce that the larger triangle above has an area of $9$ (as the sides of the triangles are in a proportion of $\\frac{1}{3}$ , so will their areas have a proportion that is the square of the proportion of their sides, or $\\frac {1}{9}$ ). Thus, the combined area of the top triangle and the trapezoid immediately below is $7 + 9 = 16$ . The area of trapezoid $BCED$ is thus the area of triangle $ABC-16 =\\boxed{24}$ . You can assume for the base of one of the smaller triangles to be $\\frac{1}{a}$ and the height to be $2a$ , giving an area of 1. The larger triangle above the 7 smaller ones then has base $\\frac{3}{a}$ and height $6a$ , giving it an area of $9$ . Then the area of triangle $ADE$ is $16$ and $40-16=\\boxed{24}$ . You can construct another trapezoid directly above the one shown, with it's bottom length as the top length of the original. Its area would then be 9/16 of the original. Repeating this process infinitely gives us the sequence $7\\cdot\\left(1+\\left(\\frac{9}{16}\\right)+\\left(\\frac{9}{16}\\right)^2+\\left(\\frac{9}{16}\\right)^3\\dots\\right)$ . Using the infinite geometric series sum formula gives us $7\\cdot\\left(\\frac{1}{1-\\frac{9}{16}}\\right)=7\\cdot\\frac{16}{7}=16$ . The triangle's area would thus be $40-16=\\boxed{24}$ . -ConcaveTriangle Note that the area of an isosceles triangle is equivalent to the square of its height. Using this information, the height of the smallest isosceles triangle is $1$ , and thus its base is $2.$  Let $h$ be the height of the top triangle. We can set up a height-to-base similarity ratio, using the top triangle and $\\triangle{ADE}$ . The top triangle has a base of $3\\cdot{2}=6$ , and $DE=4\\cdot{2}=8.$ The height of $\\triangle{ADE}$ is $h+1$ , therefore our ratio is $\\frac{h}{6}=\\frac{h+1}{8}$ , which yields $h=3$ as our answer. To find the area of the trapezoid, we can take the area of $\\triangle{ABC}$ and subtract the area of $\\triangle{ADE},$ whose base is $8$ and height $3+1=4$ . It follows that the area of $\\triangle{ADE}=16$ , and subtracting this from $40$ gives us $40-16=\\boxed{\\text{D) }24}$ . -Benedict T (countmath1) https://youtu.be/lgkkomUwSs0  ~Education, the Study of Everything  https://youtu.be/HJALwsbHZXc  ~Whiz https://youtu.be/ZiZVIMmo260  ~IceMatrix https://youtu.be/tq4rWskQDh8  ~savannahsolver https://youtu.be/4_x1sgcQCp4?t=2959  ~pi_is_3.14\n",

Note In general, whenever we are asked to make a crease, think about that crease as a line of reflection over which the diagram is reflected. This is why the crease must be the perpendicular bisector of $AB$ , because $A$ must be reflected onto $B$ . Use the ruler and graph paper you brought to quickly draw a 3-4-5 triangle of any scale (don't trust the diagram in the booklet). Very carefully fold the acute vertices together and make a crease. Measure the crease with the ruler. If you were reasonably careful, you should see that it measures somewhat more than $\\frac{7}{4}$ units and somewhat less than $2$ units. The only answer choice in that range is $\\boxed{\\textbf{D) } \\frac{15}{8}}$ . This is pretty much a cop-out, but it's allowed in the rules technically.

Make use of the diagram in Solution 3. It can be deduced that $AF=BF$ . Let $DF=x$ . In $\\triangle ADF$ , $AF^2=x^2+2.5^2 \\Rightarrow AF=\\sqrt{x^2+2.5^2}$ . Then $FC$ also would be $4-\\sqrt{x^2+2.5^2}$ . In $\\triangle BCF$ , $BF^2=FC^2+BC^2 \\Rightarrow (\\sqrt{x^2+2.5^2})^2=(4-\\sqrt{x^2+2.5^2})^2+3^2$ . After some quick math, we get $\\sqrt{x^2+2.5^2}=\\frac{25}{8}$ .\n",
      "Solving for $x$ will give $x=\\frac{15}{8}$ . $\\therefore$  $DF=x=$  $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) } \\frac{15}{8}}$ . Like in Solution 3, we can make use of coordinate geometry to solve this problem. Because the length of the crease is constant no matter the positioning of the triangle, reorient the triangle so it has C at the origin and B and A at $(0,3)$ and $(4,0)$ respectively.

The crease therefore has a slope of $\\frac{4}{3}$ . Plugging into point-slope we find that the equation of the crease is, $y-y_1=m(x-x_1)\\implies y-\\frac{3}{2}=\\frac{4}{3}(x-2)\\implies y=\\frac{4}{3}x-\\frac{7}{6}$  Using 0 for y, we see that the crease intersects $AC$ at $(\\frac{7}{8},0)$ . By the Distance Formula, $(2-\\frac{7}{8})^2+({\\frac{3}{2}})^2=d^2 \\implies d^2=\\frac{225}{64} \\implies d=\\boxed{\\frac{15}{8}}$  Let $D$ be a point on AC such that $AD=DB$ and $\\triangle{ADB}$ is isosceles. The altitude of this triangle is the crease of the paper triangle. Setting $DC=x$ , we have a right triangle $\\triangle{BCD}$ with legs of x and 3, and, because $AD=DB,$ hypotenuse of $(4-x)$ . $x^2+3^2=(4-x)^2 \\implies x^2+9=16-8x+x^2 \\implies 8x=7 \\implies x=\\frac{7}{8}$  The area of $\\triangle{BCD}  \\text{ is thus} = \\frac{7}{8}*3*\\frac{1}{2} \\implies \\frac{21}{16}.$ Because $[ADB]=[ABC]-[BCD],$ we can plug in and see that $[ADB]=6-\\frac{21}{16}=\\frac{75}{16}.$  Since $A=\\frac{bh}{2}$ , we get $\\frac{75}{16}=\\frac{5h}{2} \\implies 5h=\\frac{75}{8} \\implies h=\\boxed{\\frac{15}{8}}$  Our answer is $D$ . https://youtu.be/92WxfAyVumE  ~Education, the Study of Everything  https://youtu.be/HJALwsbHZXc  ~ Whiz https://youtu.be/4_x1sgcQCp4?t=2623  ~ pi_is_3.14\n",

      " We start with $2$ because $1$ is not an answer choice. We would have to include every odd number except $1$ to fill out the set, but then $3$ and $9$ would violate the rule, so that won't work. Experimentation with $3$ shows it's likewise impossible. You can include $7,11,$ and either $5$ or $10$ (which are always safe). But after adding either $4$ or $8$ we have no more valid numbers. Finally, starting with $4,$ we find that the sequence $4,5,6,7,9,11$ works, giving us $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C)}\\ 4}.$  We know that all odd numbers except $1,$ namely $3, 5, 7, 9, 11,$ can be used. Now we have $7$ possibilities to choose from for the last number (out of $1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12$ ). We can eliminate $1, 2, 10,$ and $12,$ and we have $4, 6, 8$ to choose from. However, $9$ is a multiple of $3.$ Now we have to take out either $3$ or $9$ from the list. If we take out $9,$ none of the numbers would work, but if we take out $3,$ we get \\[4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11.\\] The least number is $4,$ so the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C)}\\ 4}.$  We can get the multiples for the numbers in the original set with multiples in the same original set \\begin{align*} 1&: \\ \\text{all elements of }\\{1,2,\\dots,12\\} \\\\ 2&: \\ 4,6,8,10,12 \\\\ 3&: \\ 6,9,12 \\\\ 4&: \\ 8,12 \\\\ 5&: \\ 10 \\\\ 6&: \\ 12 \\end{align*} It will be safe to start with $5$ or $6$ since they have the smallest number of multiples as listed above, but since the question asks for the least, it will be better to try others.

      " This looks like balanced ternary, in which all the integers with absolute values less than $\\frac{3^n}{2}$ are represented in $n$ digits. There are 8 digits. Plugging in 8 into the formula for the balanced ternary gives a maximum bound of $|x|=3280.5$ , which means there are 3280 positive integers, 0, and 3280 negative integers. Since we want all nonnegative integers, there are $3280+1=\\boxed{3281}$ integers or $\\boxed{\\textbf{D}}$ . Note that all numbers formed from this sum are either positive, negative or zero. The number of positive numbers formed by this sum is equal to the number of negative numbers formed by this sum, because of symmetry. There is only one way to achieve a sum of zero, if all $a_i=0$ . The total number of ways to pick $a_i$ from $i=0, 1, 2, 3, ... 7$ is $3^8=6561$ . $\\frac{6561-1}{2}=3280$ gives the number of possible negative integers. The question asks for the number of non-negative integers, so subtracting from the total gives $6561-3280=\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) } 3281}$ . (RegularHexagon, KLBBC minor changes) Note that the number of total possibilities (ignoring the conditions set by the problem) is $3^8=6561$ . So, E is clearly unrealistic.

Therefore, if $a_7$ is 1, there are $3^7=2187$ possibilities. (We also must convince ourselves that these $2187$ different sets of coefficients must necessarily yield $2187$ different integer results.) As A, B, and C are all less than 2187, the answer must be $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) } 3281}$  Note that we can do some simple casework:\n",

      "Continuing in this vein, we have $3^7+3^6+\\cdots+3^1+3^0$ ways to choose the variables' values, except we have to add 1\n",
      "because we haven't counted the case where all variables are 0. So our total sum is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) } 3281}$ .\n",
      "Note that we have counted all possibilities, because the largest positive positive power of 3 must be greater than or equal to the largest negative positive power of 3, for the number to be nonnegative. This solution has a similar idea to that of above.\n",
      "We will start off with casework on $a_{7}$ :\n",
      "If $a_7 = -1$ , we can show that there is no way to assign the values of $-1, 0, 1$ to the other $a_{i}$ 's for $0 \\leq i \\leq 6$ .

However, note that since $\\frac{3^{7}-1}{3-1} < 3^{7}$ , $-3^{7} + \\frac{3^{7}-1}{3-1} < 0$ .\n",
      "If $a_{7}=0$ , we can ignore $a_{7}$ and pretend like it never even existed. This then simplifies the problem: the question remains the same, except that instead of having $a_{0}...a_{7}$ , we only have $a_{0}...a_{6}$ . Now, we introduce some notation: let the number of nonnegative integers that can be written in the form of $a_{n} \\cdot 3^{n} + ... + a_{0} \\cdot 3^{0}$ be denoted as $S_{n}$ . Then, the problem is asking us for $S_{7}$ , and the total number of nonnegative integers we get from this case is $S_{6}$ . Let's keep this in mind and revisit this idea later.\n",
      "If $a_{7}=1$ , we can show that no matter what values we assign to the rest of the $a_{i}$ , we will always get a nonnegative integer (we can make this even stricter and say positive integer). This is because of something we figured out in the first case: $\\frac{3^{7}-1}{3-1} < 3^{7}$ . So, even if we let $a_{i}=-1$ for $0 \\leq i \\leq 6$ , we will still have $3^{7} - (3^{6}+...+3^{0}) > 0$ . So, for this case, we have $3^7$ possible nonnegative integers.\n",
      "Totalling up our values from the three cases, we see that $S_{7} = 0 + S_{6} + 3^{7}$ . In fact, using the reasoning from the three cases above, we can deduce that, for all positive integers $n$ , $S_{n} = 3^{n} + S_{n-1}$ . We can now start building up our values for $S$ : $S_{0} = 2$ ( $a_{0} = 0, 1$ ), $S_{1} = 3^{1}+S_{0} = 5, S_{2} = 14, ..., S_{6}=1094$ .

By symmetry (look out for these on the contest), we see that exactly half of them are positive.

Since we must subtract off $2$ cases for the all-black and all-white cases, the answer is $2^{10}-2=\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) } 1022.}$  \\[\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \\hline T & T & T & X & T & T & T \\\\ \\hline T & T & T & Y& T & T & T \\\\ \\hline T & T & T & Z & T & T & T \\\\ \\hline X & Y & Z & W & Z & Y & X \\\\ \\hline T & T & T & Z & T & T & T \\\\ \\hline T & T & T & Y & T & T & T \\\\ \\hline T & T & T & X & T & T & T \\\\ \\hline \\end{tabular}\\]  There are $3 \\times 3$ squares in the corners of this $7 \\times 7$ square, and there is a horizontal and vertical stripe through the middle. Because we need to have symmetry when the diagonals and midpoints of the large square is connected, we can create a table like this: (Different letters represent different color choices between black and white) \\[\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \\hline A & B & C \\\\ \\hline B & D & E \\\\ \\hline C & E & F \\\\ \\hline \\end{tabular}\\] (Note that coloring one $3 \\times 3$ square will also determine the colorings of the other $3$ because the large $7 \\times 7$ square must look the same when it is rotated by $90^\\circ$ ) There are $6$ different letters and $2$ choices of color (black and white) for each letter, so there are $2^6=64$ colorings of a proper $3 \\times 3$ square. Now, all that's left are the horizontal and vertical stripes. Using similar logic, we can see that there are $4$ different letters, so there are $2^4=16$ different colorings. Multiplying them together gives $16 \\times 64 = 1024$ . Going back to the question, we see that \"there must be at least one square of each color in this grid of $49$ squares.\" We must then eliminate $2$ options: an all-black grid and an all-white grid. $1024-2= \\boxed{\\textbf{(B)} 1022} \\\\ \\phantom{}$ -hansenhe https://youtu.be/M22S82Am2zM  ~IceMatrix \n",

      " Let $BC = a$ , $BG = x$ , $GC = y$ , and the length of the perpendicular from $BC$ through $A$ be $h$ . By angle bisector theorem, we have that \\[\\frac{50}{x} = \\frac{10}{y},\\] where $y = -x+a$ . Therefore substituting we have that $BG=\\frac{5a}{6}$ . By similar triangles, we have that $DF=\\frac{5a}{12}$ , and the height of this trapezoid is $\\frac{h}{2}$ . Then, we have that $\\frac{ah}{2}=120$ . We wish to compute $\\frac{5a}{8}\\cdot\\frac{h}{2}$ , and we have that it is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) }75}$ by substituting. For this problem, we have $\\triangle{ADE}\\sim\\triangle{ABC}$ because of SAS and $DE = \\frac{BC}{2}$ . Therefore, $\\bigtriangleup ADE$ is a quarter of the area of $\\bigtriangleup ABC$ , which is $30$ . Subsequently, we can compute the area of quadrilateral $BDEC$ to be $120 - 30 = 90$ . Using the angle bisector theorem in the same fashion as the previous problem, we get that $\\overline{BG}$ is $5$ times the length of $\\overline{GC}$ . We want the larger piece, as described by the problem. Because the heights are identical, one area is $5$ times the other, and $\\frac{5}{6} \\cdot 90 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(D) }75}$ . The ratio of the $\\overline{BG}$ to $\\overline{GC}$ is $5:1$ by the Angle Bisector Theorem, so area of $\\bigtriangleup ABG$ to the area of $\\bigtriangleup ACG$ is also $5:1$ (They have the same height). Therefore, the area of $\\bigtriangleup ABG$ is $\\frac{5}{5+1}\\times120=100$ . Since $\\overline{DE}$ is the midsegment of $\\bigtriangleup ABC$ , so $\\overline{DF}$ is the midsegment of $\\bigtriangleup ABG$ . Thus, the ratio of the area of $\\bigtriangleup ADF$ to the area of $\\bigtriangleup ABG$ is $1:4$ , so the area of $\\bigtriangleup ACG$ is $\\frac{1}{4}\\times100=25$ . Therefore, the area of quadrilateral $FDBG$ is $[ABG]-[ADF]=100-25=\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) }75}$  The area of quadrilateral $FDBG$ is the area of $\\bigtriangleup ABG$ minus the area of $\\bigtriangleup ADF$ . Notice, $\\overline{DE} || \\overline{BC}$ , so $\\bigtriangleup ABG \\sim \\bigtriangleup ADF$ , and since $\\overline{AD}:\\overline{AB}=1:2$ , the area of $\\bigtriangleup ADF:\\bigtriangleup ABG=(1:2)^2=1:4$ . Given that the area of $\\bigtriangleup ABC$ is $120$ , using $\\frac{bh}{2}$ on side $AB$ yields $\\frac{50h}{2}=120\\implies h=\\frac{240}{50}=\\frac{24}{5}$ . Using the Angle Bisector Theorem, $\\overline{BG}:\\overline{BC}=50:(10+50)=5:6$ , so the height of $\\bigtriangleup ABG: \\bigtriangleup ACB=5:6$ . Therefore our answer is $\\big[ FDBG\\big] = \\big[ABG\\big]-\\big[ ADF\\big] = \\big[ ABG\\big]\\big(1-\\frac{1}{4}\\big)=\\frac{3}{4}\\cdot \\frac{bh}{2}=\\frac{3}{8}\\cdot 50\\cdot \\frac{5}{6}\\cdot \\frac{24}{5}=\\frac{3}{8}\\cdot 200=\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) }75}$  We try to find the area of quadrilateral $FDBG$ by subtracting the area outside the quadrilateral but inside triangle $ABC$ . Note that the area of $\\triangle ADE$ is equal  to $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 25 \\cdot 5 \\cdot \\sin{A}$ and the area of triangle $ABC$ is equal to $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 50 \\cdot 10 \\cdot \\sin A$ . The ratio $\\frac{[ADE]}{[ABC]}$ is thus equal to $\\frac{1}{4}$ and the area of triangle $ADE$ is $\\frac{1}{4} \\cdot 120 = 30$ . Let side $BC$ be equal to $6x$ , then $BG = 5x, GC = x$ by the angle bisector theorem. Similarly, we find the area of triangle $AGC$ to be $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 10 \\cdot x \\cdot \\sin C$ and the area of triangle $ABC$ to be $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 6x \\cdot 10 \\cdot \\sin C$ . A ratio between these two triangles yields $\\frac{[ACG]}{[ABC]} = \\frac{x}{6x} = \\frac{1}{6}$ , so $[AGC] = 20$ . Now we just need to find the area of triangle $AFE$ and subtract it from the combined areas of $[ADE]$ and $[ACG]$ , since we count it twice. Note that the angle bisector theorem also applies for $\\triangle ADE$ and $\\frac{AE}{AD} = \\frac{1}{5}$ , so thus $\\frac{EF}{ED} = \\frac{1}{6}$ and we find $[AFE] = \\frac{1}{6} \\cdot 30 = 5$ , and the area outside $FDBG$ must be $[ADE] + [AGC] - [AFE] = 30 + 20 - 5 = 45$ , and we finally find $[FDBG] = [ABC] - 45 = 120 -45 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(D) }75}$ , and we are done. = Let our reference triangle be $\\triangle ABC$ . Consequently, we have $A=(1,0,0)$ , $B=(0,1,0)$ , $C=(0,0,1).$ Since $D$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{AB}$ , we have that $D=(1:1:0)$ . Similarly, we have $E=(1:0:1).$ Hence, the line through $D$ and $E$ is given by the equation \\[0 =  \\begin{vmatrix} x & y & z\\\\ 1 & 1 & 0\\\\ 1 & 0 & 1 \\end{vmatrix}\\]  Additionally, since all points on $\\overline{AG}$ are characterized by $(t:1:5)$ , we may plug in for $x,y,z$ to get $t=6$ . Thus, we have $F=(6:1:5).$ Now, we homogenize the coordinates for $F D, B, G$ to get $F=(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{5}{12}, \\frac{1}{12})$ , $D=(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2}, 0)$ , $B=(0,1,0)$ , $G=(0, \\frac{1}{6}, \\frac{5}{6})$  Splitting $[FBGD]$ into $[ DBG ] + [ FDG],$ we may now evaluate the two determinants: \\[\\begin{vmatrix} \\frac{1}{2} & \\frac{1}{2} & 0\\\\ 0 & 1 & 0\\\\ 0 & \\frac{1}{6} & \\frac{5}{6} \\end{vmatrix}\\]  \\[\\begin{vmatrix} \\frac{1}{2} & \\frac{1}{12} & \\frac{5}{12}\\\\ \\frac{1}{2} & \\frac{1}{2} & 0\\\\ 0 & \\frac{5}{6} & \\frac{1}{6} \\end{vmatrix}.\\]  After simplification, we get $\\frac{5}{12}$ and $\\frac{5}{24}$ , respectively. Summing, we get $\\frac{15}{24}.$ Hence, $[FBGD]=\\frac{15}{24} \\cdot 120 = \\fbox{\\textbf{(D) }75}.$  $\\sim$ Math0323 https://artofproblemsolving.com/videos/amc/2018amc10a/469  ~ dolphin7 https://youtu.be/4_x1sgcQCp4?t=4898  ~ pi_is_3.14\n",

      " Note that the fractions of the form $\\frac{1}{2^a3^b5^c},$ where $a,b,$ and $c$ are nonnegative integers, span all terms of the infinite sum.

Clearly this is just summing over the reciprocals of the numbers of the form $2^i3^j5^k$ , where $i,j,k\\in [0,\\infty)$ . SO our desired sum is $\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}\\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty}\\sum_{i=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{2^i3^j5^k}$ . By the infinite geometric series formula, $\\sum_{i=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{2^i3^j5^k}$ is just $\\frac{\\frac{1}{3^j5^k}}{1-\\frac{1}{2}}=\\frac{2}{3^j5^k}$ . Applying the infinite geometric series formula again gives that $\\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{2}{3^j5^k}=\\frac{\\frac{2}{5^k}}{1-\\frac{1}{3}}=\\frac{3}{5^k}$ . Applying the infinite geometric series formula again yields $\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{3}{5^k}=\\frac{3}{1-\\frac{1}{5}}=\\frac{15}{4}$ . Hence our final answer is $15+4=\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) } 19}$ . ~vsamc Separate into $7$ separate infinite series's so we can calculate each and find the original sum: The first infinite sequence shall be all the reciprocals of the powers of $2$ , the second shall be reciprocals of the powers of $3$ , and the third will consist of reciprocals of the powers of $5$ . We can easily calculate these to be $1, \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{4}$ respectively. The fourth infinite series shall be all real numbers in the form $\\frac{1}{2^a3^b}$ , where $a,b\\geq1$ . The fifth is all real numbers in the form $\\frac{1}{2^a5^b}$ , where $a,b\\geq1$ . The sixth is all real numbers in the form $\\frac{1}{3^a5^b}$ , where $a,b\\geq1$ . The seventh infinite series is all real numbers in the form $\\frac{1}{2^a3^b5^c}$ , where $a,b,c\\geq1$ . Let us denote the first sequence as $a_{1}$ , the second as $a_{2}$ , etc. We know $a_{1}=1$ , $a_{2}=\\frac{1}{2}$ , $a_{3}=\\frac{1}{4}$ , let us find $a_{4}$ . factoring out $\\frac{1}{6}$ from the terms in this subsequence, we would get $a_{4}=\\frac{1}{6}(1+a_{1}+a_{2}+a_{4})$ . Knowing $a_{1}$ and $a_{2}$ , we can substitute and solve for $a_{4}$ , and we get $\\frac{1}{2}$ . If we do similar procedures for the fifth and sixth sequences, we can solve for them too, and we get after solving them $\\frac{1}{4}$ and $\\frac{1}{8}$ . Finally, for the seventh sequence, we see $a_{7}=\\frac{a_{8}}{30}$ , where $a_{8}$ is the infinite series the problem is asking us to solve for. The sum of all seven subsequences will equal the one we are looking for, and we need to add the $\\frac11$ term back: $1+1+\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{4}+\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{4}+\\frac{1}{8}+\\frac{a_{8}}{30}=a_{8}$ . We solve this to get $\\frac{29}{8}=\\frac{29a_{8}}{30}$ , or $\\frac{15}{4}=a_{8}$ . So our answer is $\\frac{15}{4}$ , but we are asked to add the numerator and denominator, which sums up to $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) } 19}$ . ~~Edited by mprincess0229~~ First of all, we need to find some geometric sequences hidden in here. The first sequence is just $\\frac{1}{1}$ . We can just leave this 1 by itself. The second sequence contains all numbers in the form of $\\frac{1}{2^p}$ . This is just 1/2+1/4+...=1. The third sequence contains all numbers in the form of $\\frac{1}{2^p\\cdot 3}$ . These add to $\\frac{\\frac13}{\\frac12}$ . The fourth sequence contains all numbers in the form of $\\frac{1}{2^p\\cdot 5}$ . These add to $\\frac{\\frac15}{\\frac12}$ . Essentially, every number is contained in a sequence that starts with the term that is the reciprocal of the result when the number is repeatedly divided by 2 until the number is odd. These will add up to $1+1+\\frac{\\frac{1}{3}+\\frac{1}{5}+\\frac{1}{9}+\\frac{1}{15}+\\frac{1}{25}+\\frac{1}{27}+\\cdots}{\\frac{1}{2}}$ . Note that the numerator of that fraction is the sum of the reciprocals of every number with only 3 or 5 in its prime factorization. Let's call that numerator $x$ . So now, we find $x$ . That strategy worked out pretty well. Let's use it again. The first sequence contains all numbers in the form of $\\frac{1}{3^p}$ . These add to $\\frac{\\frac13}{\\frac23}$ . The second sequence contains all numbers in the form of $\\frac{1}{3^p\\cdot5}$ . These add to $\\frac{\\frac15}{\\frac23}$ . The third sequence contains all numbers in the form of $\\frac{1}{3^p\\cdot 5^2}$ . These add to $\\frac{\\frac{1}{25}}{\\frac{2}{3}}$  Essentially, every number is contained in a sequence that starts with the term that is the reciprocal of the result when the number is repeatedly divided by 3 until the number is not divisible by 3. The total sum for $x$ is $\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{\\text{a geometric sequence}}{\\frac{2}{3}}$ , and that geometric sequence evaluates to $\\frac{\\frac{1}{5}}{1-\\frac{1}{5}}=\\frac{1}{4}$ . Then we just need to do the computation. $x$ is $\\frac{\\frac14}{\\frac23}+\\frac12=\\frac78$ . Recalling our answer is $\\frac{x}{\\frac12}+2$ , we can plug in $x$ to get a final answer of $\\frac{7}{4}+2=\\frac{15}{4}$ . Finally, we can add $15+4=\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) } 19}$ . ~yrock What's up with the LaTeX rendering? Someone help...

      " Observe that $\\triangle{EMI}$ is isosceles right ( $M$ is the midpoint of diameter arc $EI$ since $m\\angle MEI = m\\angle MAI = 45^\\circ$ ), so $MI=2,MC=\\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2}}$ . With $\\angle{MCI}=45^\\circ$ , we can use Law of Cosines to determine that $CI=\\frac{3\\pm\\sqrt{7}}{2}$ . The same calculations hold for $BE$ also, and since $CI<BE$ , we deduce that $CI$ is the smaller root, giving the answer of $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) }12}$ . We first claim that $\\triangle{EMI}$ is isosceles and right. Proof: Construct $\\overline{MF}\\perp\\overline{AB}$ and $\\overline{MG}\\perp\\overline{AC}$ . Since $\\overline{AM}$ bisects $\\angle{BAC}$ , one can deduce that $MF=MG$ . Then by AAS it is clear that $MI=ME$ and therefore $\\triangle{EMI}$ is isosceles. Since quadrilateral $AIME$ is cyclic, one can deduce that $\\angle{EMI}=90^\\circ$ . Q.E.D. Since the area of $\\triangle{EMI}$ is 2, we can find that $MI=ME=2$ , $EI=2\\sqrt{2}$  Since $M$ is the mid-point of $\\overline{BC}$ , it is clear that $AM=\\frac{3\\sqrt{2}}{2}$ . Now let $AE=a$ and $AI=b$ . By Ptolemy's Theorem, in cyclic quadrilateral $AIME$ , we have $2a+2b=6$ . By Pythagorean Theorem, we have $a^2+b^2=8$ . One can solve the simultaneous system and find $b=\\frac{3+\\sqrt{7}}{2}$ . Then by deducting the length of $\\overline{AI}$ from 3 we get $CI=\\frac{3-\\sqrt{7}}{2}$ , giving the answer of $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) }12}$ . (Surefire2019) Like above, notice that $\\triangle{EMI}$ is isosceles and right, which means that $\\dfrac{ME \\cdot MI}{2} = 2$ , so $MI^2=4$ and $MI = 2$ . Then construct $\\overline{MF}\\perp\\overline{AB}$ and $\\overline{MG}\\perp\\overline{AC}$ as well as $\\overline{MI}$ . It's clear that $MG^2+GI^2 = MI^2$ by Pythagorean, so knowing that $MG = \\dfrac{AB}{2} = \\dfrac{3}{2}$ allows one to solve to get $GI = \\dfrac{\\sqrt{7}}{2}$ . By just looking at the diagram, $CI=AC-MF-GI=\\dfrac{3-\\sqrt{7}}{2}$ . The answer is thus $3+7+2=\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) }12}$ . Let $A$ lie on $(0,0)$ , $E$ on $(0,y)$ , $I$ on $(x,0)$ , and $M$ on $\\left(\\frac{3}{2},\\frac{3}{2}\\right)$ . Since ${AIME}$ is cyclic, $\\angle EMI$ (which is opposite of another right angle) must be a right angle; therefore, $\\overrightarrow{ME} \\cdot \\overrightarrow{MI} = \\left<\\frac{-3}{2}, y-\\frac{3}{2}\\right> \\cdot \\left<x-\\frac{3}{2}, -\\frac{3}{2}\\right> = 0$ . Compute the dot product to arrive at the relation $y=3-x$ . We can set up another equation involving the area of $\\triangle EMI$ using the Shoelace Theorem . This is \\[2=\\frac{1}{2}\\left[\\frac{3}{2}\\left(y-\\frac{3}{2}\\right)-xy+\\frac{3}{2}\\left(x+\\frac{3}{2}\\right)\\right].\\] Multiplying, substituting $3-x$ for $y$ , and simplifying, we get $x^2 -3x + \\frac{1}{2}=0$ . Thus, $(x,y)=\\left(\\frac{3 \\pm \\sqrt{7}}{2},\\frac{3 \\mp \\sqrt{7}}{2}\\right)$ . But $AI>AE$ , meaning $x=AI=\\frac{3 + \\sqrt{7}}{2}$ and $CI = 3-\\frac{3 + \\sqrt{7}}{2}=\\frac{3 - \\sqrt{7}}{2}$ , and the final answer is $3+7+2=\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) }12}$ . From $AIME$ cyclic we get $\\angle{MEI} = \\angle{MAI} = 45^\\circ$ and $\\angle{MIE} = \\angle{MAE} = 45^\\circ$ , so $\\triangle{EMI}$ is an isosceles right triangle. From $[EMI]=2$ we get $EM=MI=2$ . Notice $\\triangle{AEM} \\cong \\triangle{CIM}$ , because $\\angle{AEM}=180-\\angle{AIM}=\\angle{CIM}$ , $EM=IM$ , and $\\angle{EAM}=\\angle{ICM}=45^\\circ$ . Let $CI=AE=x$ , so $AI=3-x$ . By Pythagoras on $\\triangle{EAI}$ we have $x^2+(3-x)^2=EI^2=8$ , and solve this to get $x=CI=\\dfrac{3-\\sqrt{7}}{2}$ for a final answer of $3+7+2=\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) }12}$ . Let $CI=a$ , $BE=b$ . Because opposite angles in a cyclic quadrilateral are supplementary, we have $\\angle EMI=90^{\\circ}$ . By the law of cosines, we have $MI^2=a^2+\\frac{9}{4}-\\frac{3}{2}a$ , and $ME^2=b^2+\\frac{9}{4}-\\frac{3}{2}b$ . Notice that $EI=2MO$ , where $O$ is the origin of the circle mentioned in the problem. Thus $\\frac{2MO*MO}{2}=2\\implies MO=\\sqrt{2}, EI=2\\sqrt{2}$ . By the Pythagorean Theorem, we have $ME^2+MI^2=EI^2\\implies a^2+\\frac{9}{4}-\\frac{3}{2}a+b^2+\\frac{9}{4}-\\frac{3}{2}b=(2\\sqrt{2})^2=8$ . By the Pythagorean Theorem, we have $AE^2+AI^2=EI^2\\implies (3-a)^2+(3-b)^2=(2\\sqrt{2})^2=8\\implies 18-6a-6b+a^2+b^2=8$ . Thus we have $18-6a-6b+a^2+b^2=a^2+\\frac{9}{4}-\\frac{3}{2}a+b^2+\\frac{9}{4}-\\frac{3}{2}b\\implies 18-6a-6b=\\frac{9}{2}-\\frac{3}{2}a-\\frac{3}{2}b\\implies \\frac{27}{2}$  $=\\frac{9}{2}a+\\frac{9}{2}b\\implies a+b=3\\implies 3-b=a$ . We know that \\begin{align*} (3-a)^2+(3-b)^2&=8 \\\\ (3-a)^2+a^2&=8 \\\\ 2a^2-6a+9&=8 \\\\ 2a^2-6a+1&=0 \\\\ a&=\\frac{6\\pm \\sqrt{36-8}}{2}=\\frac{3\\pm\\sqrt{7}}{2}. \\end{align*} We take the smaller solution because we have $AI>AE\\implies 3-AI<3-AE\\implies CI<CE$ , and we want $CI$ , not $CE$ , thus $CI=\\frac{3-\\sqrt{7}}{2}$ . Thus our final answer is $3+7+2=\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) }12}$ . -vsamc https://youtu.be/NsQbhYfGh1Q?t=4465  ~ pi_is_3.14\n",

Newton's Method is used to approximate the zero $x_{1}$ of any real valued function given an estimation for the root $x_{0}: \\ x_{1}=x_{0}-{\\frac {f(x_{0})}{f'(x_{0})}}.$ After looking at all the options, $x_{0}=-1$ gives a reasonable estimate. For options $\\textbf{(A)}$ to $\\textbf{(D)},$ we have $f(-1) = -2018$ and the estimation becomes $x_{1}=-1+{\\frac {2018}{f'(-1)}}.$ Thus we need to minimize the derivative, giving us $\\textbf{(B)}$ . Now after comparing $\\textbf{(B)}$ and $\\textbf{(E)}$ through Newton's method, we see that $\\textbf{(B)}$ has the higher root, so the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }   x^{17}+2018x^{11}+1}$ . ~Qcumber https://artofproblemsolving.com/videos/amc/2018amc12a/471  ~ dolphin7\n",

Therefore, the greatest possible value of $a + b + c$ is $6+8+4=\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) } 18}.$  ~CantonMathGuy (Solution) ~MRENTHUSIASM (Revision) Immediately start trying $n = 1$ and $n = 2$ . These give the system of equations $11c - b = a^2$ and $1111c - 11b = (11a)^2$ (which simplifies to $101c - b = 11a^2$ ). These imply that $a^2 = 9c$ , so the possible $(a, c)$ pairs are $(9, 9)$ , $(6, 4)$ , and $(3, 1)$ . The first puts $b$ out of range but the second makes $b = 8$ . We now know the answer is at least $6 + 8 + 4 = 18$ . We now only need to know whether $a + b + c = 20$ might work for any larger $n$ . We will always get equations like $100001c - b = 11111a^2$ where the $c$ coefficient is very close to being nine times the $a$ coefficient. Since the $b$ term will be quite insignificant, we know that once again $a^2$ must equal $9c$ , and thus $a = 9, c = 9$ is our only hope to reach $20$ . Substituting and dividing through by $9$ , we will have something like $100001 - \\frac{b}{9} = 99999$ . No matter what $n$ really was, $b$ is out of range (and certainly isn't $2$ as we would have needed). The answer then is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) } 18}$ . The given equation can be written as \\[c \\cdot (\\phantom{ } \\overbrace{1111 \\ldots 1111}^{2n\\text{ digits}}\\phantom{ }) - b \\cdot (\\phantom{ } \\overbrace{11 \\ldots 11}^{n\\text{ digits}} \\phantom{ }) = a^2 \\cdot (\\phantom{ } \\overbrace{11 \\ldots 11}^{n\\text{ digits}} \\phantom{ })^2.\\] Divide by $\\overbrace{11 \\ldots 11}^{n\\text{ digits}}$ on both sides: \\[c \\cdot (\\phantom{ } \\overbrace{1000 \\ldots 0001}^{n+1\\text{ digits}}\\phantom{ }) - b = a^2 \\cdot (\\phantom{ } \\overbrace{11 \\ldots 11}^{n\\text{ digits}} \\phantom{ }).\\] Next, split the first term to make it easier to deal with: \\begin{align*} 2c + c \\cdot (\\phantom{ }\\overbrace{99 \\ldots 99}^{n\\text{ digits}}\\phantom{ }) - b &= a^2 \\cdot (\\phantom{ } \\overbrace{11 \\ldots 11}^{n\\text{ digits}} \\phantom{ }) \\\\ 2c - b &= (a^2 - 9c) \\cdot (\\phantom{ }\\overbrace{11 \\ldots 11}^{n\\text{ digits}}\\phantom{ }). \\end{align*} Because $2c - b$ and $a^2 - 9c$ are constants and because there must be at least two distinct values of $n$ that satisfy, $2c - b = a^2 - 9c = 0.$ Thus, we have \\begin{align*} 2c&=b, \\\\ a^2&=9c. \\end{align*} Knowing that $a,b,$ and $c$ are single digit positive integers and that $9c$ must be a perfect square, the values of $(a,b,c)$ that satisfy both equations are $(3,2,1)$ and $(6,8,4).$ Finally, $6 + 8 + 4 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(D) } 18}.$  ~LegionOfAvatars (Solution) ~MRENTHUSIASM (Reformatting) By PaperMath’s sum , the answer is $6+8+4=\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) } 18}$  https://artofproblemsolving.com/videos/amc/2018amc10a/470  ~ dolphin7\n",

Let $A = (-12,0)$ , $B = (12,0)$ , and $C = (x,y)$ lie on the circle $x^2 +y^2 = 12^2$ . Then, the centroid of $\\triangle ABC$ is $G = \\left(\\frac{-12 + 12 + x}{3}, \\frac{0 + 0 + y}{3}\\right) = \\left(\\frac x3,\\frac y3\\right)$ . Thus, $G$ traces out a circle with a radius $\\frac13$ of the radius of the circle that point $C$ travels on. Thus, $G$ traces out a circle of radius $\\frac{12}{3} = 4$ , which has area $16\\pi\\approx \\boxed{\\textbf{(C) } 50}$ . First we can draw a few conclusions from the given information. Firstly we can see clearly that the distance from the centroid to the center of the circle will remain the same no matter $C$ is on the circle. Also we can see that because the two legs of every triangles will always originate on the diameter, using inscribed angle rules, we know that $\\angle C = \\frac{180^\\circ}{2} = 90^\\circ$ . Now we know that all triangles $ABC$ will be a right triangle. We also know that the closed curve will simply be a circle with radius equal to the centroid of each triangle. We can now pick any arbitrary triangle, calculate its centroid, and the plug it in to the area formula. Using a $45^\\circ$ - $45^\\circ$ - $90^\\circ$ triangle in conjunction with the properties of a centroid, we can quickly see that the length of the centroid is $4$ now we can plug it in to the area formula where we get $16\\pi\\approx\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) } 50}$ . https://youtu.be/CXOOhQVsOo8  ~Education, the Study of Everything\n",

      " Suppose that Chloe is $c$ years old today, so Joey is $c+1$ years old today. After $n$ years, Chloe and Zoe will be $n+c$ and $n+1$ years old, respectively. We are given that \\[\\frac{n+c}{n+1}=1+\\frac{c-1}{n+1}\\] is an integer for $9$ nonnegative integers $n.$ It follows that $c-1$ has $9$ positive divisors. The prime factorization of $c-1$ is either $p^8$ or $p^2q^2.$ Since $c-1<100,$ the only possibility is $c-1=2^2\\cdot3^2=36,$ from which $c=37.$ We conclude that Joey is $c+1=38$ years old today. Suppose that Joey's age is a multiple of Zoe's age after $k$ years, in which Joey and Zoe will be $k+38$ and $k+1$ years old, respectively. We are given that \\[\\frac{k+38}{k+1}=1+\\frac{37}{k+1}\\] is an integer for some positive integer $k.$ It follows that $37$ is divisible by $k+1,$ so the only possibility is $k=36.$ We conclude that Joey will be $k+38=74$ years old then, from which the answer is $7+4=\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) }11}.$  ~Supercj ~MRENTHUSIASM ~Zeric Let Joey's age be $j$ , Chloe's age be $c$ , and we know that Zoe's age is $1$ . We know that there must be $9$ values $k\\in\\mathbb{Z}$ such that $c+k=a(1+k)$ where $a$ is an integer. Therefore, $c-1+(1+k)=a(1+k)$ and $c-1=(1+k)(a-1)$ . Therefore, we know that, as there are $9$ solutions for $k$ , there must be $9$ solutions for $c-1$ . We know that this must be a perfect square. Testing perfect squares, we see that $c-1=36$ , so $c=37$ . Therefore, $j=38$ . Now, since $j-1=37$ , by similar logic, $37=(1+k)(a-1)$ , so $k=36$ and Joey will be $38+36=74$ and the sum of the digits is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) }11}$ . Here's a different way of stating Solution 2: If a number is a multiple of both Chloe's age and Zoe's age, then it is a multiple of their difference. Since the difference between their ages does not change, then that means the difference between their ages has $9$ factors. Therefore, the difference between Chloe and Zoe's age is $36$ , so Chloe is $37$ , and Joey is $38$ . The common factor that will divide both of their ages is $37$ , so Joey will be $74$ . The answer is $7 + 4 =  \\boxed{\\textbf{(E) }11}$ . Similar approach to above, just explained less concisely and more in terms of the problem (less algebraic). Let $C+n$ denote Chloe's age, $J+n$ denote Joey's age, and $Z+n$ denote Zoe's age, where $n$ is the number of years from now. We are told that $C+n$ is a multiple of $Z+n$ exactly nine times. Because $Z+n$ is $1$ at $n=0$ and will increase until greater than $C-Z$ , it will hit every natural number less than $C-Z$ , including every factor of $C-Z$ . For $C+n$ to be an integral multiple of $Z+n$ , the difference $C-Z$ must also be a multiple of $Z$ , which happens if $Z$ is a factor of $C-Z$ . Therefore, $C-Z$ has nine factors. The smallest number that has nine positive factors is $2^23^2=36$ . (We want it to be small so that Joey will not have reached three digits of age before his age is a multiple of Zoe's.) We also know $Z=1$ and $J=C+1$ . Thus, \\begin{align*} C-Z&=36, \\\\ J-Z&=37. \\end{align*} By our above logic, the next time $J-Z$ is a multiple of $Z+n$ will occur when $Z+n$ is a factor of $J-Z$ . Because $37$ is prime, the next time this happens is at $Z+n=37$ , when $J+n=74$ . The answer is $7+4=\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) }11}$ . https://youtu.be/E2SbkCQ1V84  ~savannahsolver https://youtu.be/zfChnbMGLVQ?t=111  ~ pi_is_3.14\n",

Thus, the total number of $3$ -digit integers is \\[900\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\frac{1}{3}\\cdot\\frac{4}{5}\\cdot\\frac{9}{10}\\cdot\\frac{8}{9}=\\boxed{\\textbf{(A) } 96}.\\]  ~mathpro12345 We will start with the numbers that could work. This numbers include _ _ $1$ , _ _ $5$ , _ _ $7$ , _ _ $9$ . Let's work case by case. Case $1$ : _ _ $1$ : The two blanks could be any number that is $2$ mod $3$ that does not include $3$ . We have $24$ cases for this case (we could count every case). Case $2$ : _ _ $5$ : The $2$ blanks could be any number that is $1$ mod $3$ that does not include $3$ . But we could see that this case has exactly the same solutions to case $1$ because we have a $1-1$ correspondence. We can do the exact same for case $3$ . Cases $4$ : _ _ $9$ : We need the blanks to be a multiple of $3$ , but does not contain 3. We have $(12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 42, 45, 48, 51, 54, 57, 60, 66, 69, 72, 75, 78, 81, 84, 87, 90, 96, 99)$ which also contains $24$ numbers. Therefore, we have $24 \\cdot 4$ which is equal to $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A) } 96}.$  ~Arcticturn This problem is solvable by inclusion exclusion principle. There are $\\frac{999-105}{6} + 1 = 150$ odd $3$ -digit numbers divisible by $3$ . We consider the number of $3$ -digit numbers divisible by $3$ that contain either $1, 2$ or $3$ digits of $3$ . For $\\underline{AB3}$ , $AB$ is any $2$ -digit number divisible by $3$ , which gives us $\\frac{99-12}{3} + 1 = 30$ . For $\\underline{A3B}$ , for each odd $B$ , we have $3$ values of $A$ that give a valid case, thus we have $5(3) = 15$ cases. For $\\underline{3AB}$ , we also have $15$ cases, but when $B=3, 9$ , $A$ can equal $0$ , so we have $17$ cases. For $\\underline{A33}$ , we have $3$ cases. For $\\underline{3A3}$ , we have $4$ cases. For $\\underline{33A}$ , we have $2$ cases. Finally, there is just one case for $\\underline{333}$ . By inclusion exclusion principle, we get $150 - 30 - 15 - 17 + 3 + 4 + 2 - 1 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(A) } 96}$ numbers. ~Zeric https://youtu.be/mgEZOXgIZXs?t=448  ~ pi_is_3.14 https://youtu.be/vdJFrAq0NDY  ~savannahsolver\n",

For every six terms, there will be four terms that we repeat, and two terms that we don't repeat. We will exclude the first two for now, because they don't follow this pattern. First, we need to know whether or not $2016$ is part of the skip or repeat. We notice that $f(6),f(12), \\ldots,f(6n)$ all satisfy $6+6(n-1)=n,$ and we know that $2016$ satisfies this, leaving $n=336.$ Therefore, we know that $2016$ is part of the repeat section. But what number does it repeat? We know that the repeat period is $2,$ and it follows that pattern of $1,1,8,8,7,7.$ Again, since $f(6) = f(5)$ and so on  for the repeat section, $f(2016)=f(2015),$ so we don't need to worry about which one, since it repeats with period $2.$ We see that the repeat pattern of $f(6),f(12),\\ldots,f(6n)$ follows $8,14,20,$ it is an arithmetic sequence with common difference $6.$ Therefore, $2016$ is the $335$ th term of this, but including $1,$ it is $336\\cdot6+1=\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) } 2017}.$  ~CharmaineMa07292010 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aubDsjVFFTc  ~bunny1 https://youtu.be/ub6CdxulWfc  ~savannahsolver\n",

      " In this solution, let the brackets denote areas. We place the diagram in the coordinate plane: Let $A=(12,0),B=(0,5),$ and $C=(0,0).$  Since $\\triangle ABC$ is a right triangle with $\\angle ACB=90^\\circ,$ its circumcenter is the midpoint of $\\overline{AB},$ from which $O=\\left(6,\\frac52\\right).$ Note that the circumradius of $\\triangle ABC$ is $\\frac{13}{2}.$  Let $s$ denote the semiperimeter of $\\triangle ABC.$ The inradius of $\\triangle ABC$ is $\\frac{[ABC]}{s}=\\frac{30}{15}=2,$ from which $I=(2,2).$  Since $\\odot M$ is also tangent to both coordinate axes, its center is at $M=(a,a)$ and its radius is $a$ for some positive number $a.$ Let $P$ be the point of tangency of $\\odot O$ and $\\odot M.$ As $\\overline{OP}$ and $\\overline{MP}$ are both perpendicular to the common tangent line at $P,$ we conclude that $O,M,$ and $P$ are collinear.

      "Here is a graph of $y=x^2$ and $y=16\\{x\\}$ for visualization.

Thus our set of possible solutions is bounded by $(-100,100)$ . We can see that $y=x^2$ intersects each of the lines once and there are $99-(-99)+1=199$ lines for an answer of $\\boxed{\\text{(C)}~199}$ . Same as the first solution, $x^2=10,000\\{x\\}$ . We can write $x$ as $\\lfloor x \\rfloor+\\{x\\}$ .

After simplifying a lot, we get that $\\lfloor x \\rfloor^2 + 2\\lfloor x \\rfloor - 9999 < 0$ . Solving over the integers, $-101 < \\lfloor x \\rfloor < 99$ , and since $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ is an integer, there are $\\boxed{\\text{(C)}~199}$ solutions. Each value of $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ should correspond to one value of $x$ , so we are done. Let $x = a+k$ where $a$ is the integer part of $x$ and $k$ is the fractional part of $x$ .\n",
      "We can then rewrite the problem below: $(a+k)^2 + 10000a = 10000(a+k)$  From here, we get $(a+k)^2 + 10000a = 10000a + 10000k$  Solving for $a+k = x$  $(a+k)^2 = 10000k$  $x = a+k = \\pm100\\sqrt{k}$  Because $0 \\leq k < 1$ , we know that $a+k$ cannot be less than or equal to $-100$ nor greater than or equal to $100$ . Therefore: $-99 \\leq x \\leq 99$  There are $199$ elements in this range, so the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C)} \\text{ 199}}$ . Note (not by author): this solution seems to be invalid at first, because one can not determine whether $x$ is an integer or not. However, it actually works because although $x$ itself might not be an integer, it is very close to one, so there are 199 potential $x$ . Another Note (not by author of previous note): we can actually determine that $x$ =0 is the only possible integer value of $x$ is we set $x$ = $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ we end up with $x$ =0   ~YJC64002776 Notice the given equation is equivalent to $(\\lfloor x \\rfloor+\\{x\\})^2=10,000\\{x\\}$  Now we know that $\\{x\\} < 1$ so plugging in $1$ for $\\{x\\}$ we can find the upper and lower bounds for the values. $(\\lfloor x \\rfloor +1)^2 = 10,000(1)$  $(\\lfloor x \\rfloor +1) = \\pm 100$  $\\lfloor x \\rfloor = 99, -101$  And just like $\\textbf{Solution 2}$ , we see that $-101 < \\lfloor x \\rfloor < 99$ , and since $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ is an integer, there are $\\boxed{\\text{(C)}~199}$ solutions. Each value of $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ should correspond to one value of $x$ , so we are done. Firstly, if $x$ is an integer, then $10,000\\lfloor x \\rfloor=10,000x$ , so $x$ must be $0$ . If $0<x<1$ , then we know the following: $0<x^2<1$  $10,000\\lfloor x \\rfloor =0$  $0<10,000x<10,000$  Therefore, $0<x^2+10,000\\lfloor x \\rfloor <1$ , which overlaps with $0<10,000x<10,000$ . This means that there is at least one real solution between $0$ and $1$ . Since $x^2+10,000\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ increases quadratically and $10,000x$ increases linearly, there is only one solution for this case. Similarly, if $1<x<2$ , then we know the following: $1<x^2<4$  $10,000\\lfloor x \\rfloor =10,000$  $<10,000<10,000x<20,000$  By following similar logic, we can find that there is one solution between $1$ ad $2$ . We can also follow the same process to find that there are negative solutions for $x$ as well. There are not an infinite amount of solutions, so at one point there will be no solutions when $n<x<n+1$ for some integer $n$ . For there to be no solutions in a given range means that the range of $10,000\\lfloor x \\rfloor + x^2$ does not intersect the range of $10,000x$ . $x^2$ will always be positive, and $10,000\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ is less than $10,000$ less than $10,000x$ , so when $x^2 >= 10,000$ , the equation will have no solutions. This means that there are $99$ positive solutions, $99$ negative solutions, and $0$ for a total of $\\boxed{\\text{(C)}~199}$ solutions. ~Owen1204 General solution to this type of equation $f(x, \\lfloor x \\rfloor) = 0$ : 1. solve $f(x, \\lfloor x \\rfloor) = 0$ for $x$ to get $x = g(\\lfloor x \\rfloor )$ 2. apply $\\lfloor x \\rfloor \\le x < \\lfloor x \\rfloor+1$ , solve $\\lfloor x \\rfloor \\le g(\\lfloor x \\rfloor) < \\lfloor x \\rfloor+1$ to get the domain of $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ 3. get $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ from the domain of $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ because $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ is integer, then get $x$ from $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ by $x = g( \\lfloor x \\rfloor)$ Note: function $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ maps $x$ to its floor.

      " Let $O_1$ and $O_2$ be the centers of $\\omega_1$ and $\\omega_2$ respectively and draw $O_1O_2$ , $O_1P_1$ , and $O_2P_2$ . Note that $\\angle{O_1P_1P_2}$ and $\\angle{O_2P_2P_3}$ are both right. Furthermore, since $\\triangle{P_1P_2P_3}$ is equilateral, $m\\angle{P_1P_2P_3} = 60^\\circ$ and $m\\angle{O_2P_2P_1} = 30^\\circ$ . Mark $M$ as the base of the altitude from $O_2$ to $P_1P_2.$ Since $\\triangle P_2O_2M$ is a 30-60-90 triangle, $O_2M = 2$ and $P_2M = 2\\sqrt{3}$ . Also, since $O_1O_2 = 8$ and $O_1P_1 = 4$ , we can find $P_1M = \\sqrt{8^2 - (4 + 2)^2} = 2\\sqrt{7}$ . Thus, $P_1P_2 = P_1M + P_2M = 2\\sqrt{3} + 2\\sqrt{7}$ . This makes \\[\\left[P_1P_2P_3\\right] = \\frac{\\sqrt 3}4\\cdot\\left(2\\sqrt 3 + 2\\sqrt 7\\right)^2 = 10\\sqrt 3 + 6\\sqrt 7 = \\sqrt{300} + \\sqrt{252}.\\] So, our answer is $252 + 300 = \\boxed{\\textbf{D) }552}$ . Note by diyarv: A way to see that $P_1M = 2{\\sqrt 7}$ is through similar triangles. Call the intersection between $P_1M$ and $O_1O_2$  $S$ . Since angles $\\angle{O_1P_1S}$ and $\\angle{O_2MS}$ are both right angles, and $\\angle{P_1SO_1}$ and $\\angle{MSO_2}$ are congruent, triangles $\\triangle{P_1SO_1}$ and $\\triangle{MSO_2}$ are similar by AA similarity. And, since $O_1P_1$ is $4$ and $O_2M$ is 2, the common ratio is $2$ . Using the fact that $O_1S + SO_2 = 8$ , we see that these lengths are $\\frac{16}{3}$ and $\\frac{8}{3}$ respectively. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we see that $P_1S$ and $SP_2$ are $\\frac{2\\sqrt{7}}{3}$ and $\\frac{4\\sqrt{7}}{3}$ respectively, giving us a sum of $2\\sqrt{7}$ . Let $O_i$ be the center of circle $\\omega_i$ for $i=1,2,3$ , and let $K$ be the intersection of lines $O_1P_1$ and $O_2P_2$ . Because $\\angle P_1P_2P_3 = 60^\\circ$ , it follows that $\\triangle P_2KP_1$ is a $30-60-90$ triangle. Let $x=P_1K$ ; then $P_2K = 2x$ and $P_1P_2 = x \\sqrt 3$ . The Law of Cosines in $\\triangle O_1KO_2$ gives \\[8^2 = (x+4)^2 + (2x-4)^2 - 2(x+4)(2x-4)\\cos 60^\\circ,\\] which simplifies to $3x^2 - 12x - 16 = 0$ . The positive solution is $x = 2 + \\tfrac23\\sqrt{21}$ . Then $P_1P_2 = x\\sqrt 3 = 2\\sqrt 3 + 2\\sqrt 7$ , and so the area of $\\triangle P_1P_2P_3$ is \\[\\frac{\\sqrt 3}4\\cdot\\left(2\\sqrt 3 + 2\\sqrt 7\\right)^2 = 10\\sqrt 3 + 6\\sqrt 7 = \\sqrt{300} + \\sqrt{252}.\\] The requested sum is $300 + 252 = \\boxed{552}$ . Let $O_i$ be the center of circle $\\omega_i$ for $i=1,2,3$ . Let $X$ be the centroid of $\\triangle{O_1O_2O_3}$ , which also happens to be the centroid of $\\triangle{P_1P_2P_3}$ . Because $m\\angle{O_1P_1P_2} = 90^\\circ$ and $m\\angle{O_1P_1X} = 30^\\circ$ , $m\\angle{O_1P_1X} = 60^\\circ$ . $O_2M$ is $2/3$ the height of $\\triangle{P_1P_2P_3}$ , thus $O_2M$ is $8*\\sqrt{3}/3$ . Applying cosine law on $\\triangle{O_1P_1X}$ , one finds that $P_1X = 2 + 2*\\sqrt{21}/3$ . Multiplying by $3/2$ to solve for the height of $\\triangle{P_1P_2P_3}$ , one gets $3 + \\sqrt{21}$ . Simply multiplying by $2/\\sqrt{3}$ and then calculating the equilateral triangle's area, one would get the final result of $\\sqrt{300} + \\sqrt{252}$ .

To do this, we notice that it is easier to graph the equilateral triangle first, then the circles, rather than the other way around. Let's forget the lengths of the radius for a moment and focus instead on the ratio of the circles' radius to $\\triangle P_1P_2P_3$ 's side length. WLOG let $P_1P_2 = 2$ . Place triangle $P_1P_2P_3$ on the coordinate plane with $P_1(0,\\sqrt3)$ , $P_2(1,0)$ , and $P_3(-1,0)$ . Let $r$ be the radius of the circles. Now, we find the coordinates of the centers of circles $\\omega_1$ and $\\omega_2$ . Since $\\omega_2$ is tangent to the x-axis at $(1,0)$ , the center of $\\omega_2$ is $(1,r)$ . Draw a right triangle with legs parallel to the x and y axes, and with hypotenuse as the segment from the center of $\\omega_1$ to $P_1$ . Since the slope of $\\overline{P_1P_2}$ is $-\\sqrt3$ , the slope of the hypotenuse is $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}$ , so the right triangle is $30-60-90$ . It's easy to see that the center of $\\omega_1$ is $\\left(-\\frac{r\\sqrt{3}}{2}, \\sqrt{3} - \\frac{r}{2}\\right)$ . Since $\\omega_1$ and $\\omega_2$ are tangent, the distance between the centers is $2r$ , so we have \\[\\sqrt{\\left(1 + \\frac{r\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{3r}{2} - \\sqrt{3}\\right)^2} = 2r\\]  \\[\\left(1 + \\frac{r\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{3r}{2} - \\sqrt{3}\\right)^2 = 4r^2\\]  \\[1 + r\\sqrt{3} + \\frac{3r^2}{4} + \\frac{9r^2}{4} - 3r\\sqrt{3} + 3 = 4r^2\\]  \\[4 - 2r\\sqrt{3} + 3r^2 = 4r^2\\]  \\[r^2 + 2r\\sqrt{3} - 4 = 0\\] By the Quadratic Formula, $r = \\frac{-2\\sqrt{3} \\pm \\sqrt{12 + 16}}{2} = -\\sqrt{3}\\pm\\sqrt{7}$ .\n",
      "We take the positive value to get the radius of the circle is $\\sqrt{7} - \\sqrt{3}$ .

      " We might at first think that the answer would be $9$ , because $1+2+3 \\dots +n = 45$ when $n = 9$ . But note that the problem says that they can be integers, not necessarily positive. Observe also that every term in the sequence $-44, -43, \\cdots, 44, 45$ cancels out except $45$ .  Thus, the answer is, intuitively, $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) } 90 }$ integers. Though impractical, a proof of maximality can proceed as follows:  Let the desired sequence of consecutive integers be $a, a+1, \\cdots, a+(N-1)$ , where there are $N$ terms, and we want to maximize $N$ .  Then the sum of the terms in this sequence is $aN + \\frac{(N-1)(N)}{2}=45$ .  Rearranging and factoring, this reduces to $N(2a+N-1) = 90$ .  Since $N$ must divide $90$ , and we know that $90$ is an attainable value of the sum, $90$ must be the maximum. To maximize the number of integers, we need to make the average of them as low as possible while still being positive. The average can be $\\frac12$ if the middle two numbers are $0$ and $1$ , so the answer is $\\frac{45}{\\frac12}=\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) } 90 }$ . https://youtu.be/ZhAZ1oPe5Ds?t=665  ~ pi_is_3.14 https://youtu.be/ivYp-eNOIZA  ~savannahsolver\n",

Now, the mean, $\\mu$ , must be smaller than $16$ , since there are many fewer $29$ s, $30$ s, and $31$ s. $d$ is less than $\\mu$ , because when calculating $\\mu$ , we would include $29$ , $30$ , and $31$ . Thus the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) } d < \\mu < M}$ . As in Solution 1, we find that the median is $16$ . Then, looking at the modes $(1-28)$ , we realize that even if we were to have $12$ of each, their median would remain the same, being $14.5$ . As for the mean, we note that the mean of the first $28$ is simply the same as the median of them, which is $14.5$ . Hence, since we in fact have $29$ 's, $30$ 's, and $31$ 's, the mean has to be higher than $14.5$ . On the other hand, since there are fewer $29$ 's, $30$ 's, and $31$ 's than the rest of the numbers, the mean has to be lower than $16$ (the median). By comparing these values, the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) } d < \\mu < M}$ . We can solve this problem simply by carefully calculating each of the values, which turn out to be $M=16$ , $d=14.5$ , and $\\mu = \\frac{\\sum_{n=1}^{30} 12n - 29 - 30 +31*7}{365} \\approx 15.7$ .

We now prove that it is impossible to obtain two intersections. We proceed by contradiction.  Assume a configuration of four lines exists such that there exist only two intersection points.  Let these intersection points be $A$ and $B$ .  Consider two cases: Case 1 :  No line passes through both $A$ and $B$  Then, since an intersection point is obtained by an intersection between at least two lines, two lines pass through each of $A$ and $B$ .  Then, since there can be no additional intersections, the 2 lines that pass through $A$ cant intersect the 2 lines that pass through $B$ , and so 2 lines passing through $A$ must be parallel to 2 lines passing through $B$ . Then the two lines passing through $B$ are parallel to each other by transitivity of parallelism, so they coincide, contradiction. Case 2 :  There is a line passing through $A$ and $B$  Then there must be a line $l_a$ passing through $A$ , and a line $l_b$ passing through $B$ .  These lines must be parallel.  The fourth line $l$ must pass through either $A$ or $B$ .  Without loss of generality, suppose $l$ passes through $A$ .  Then since $l$ and $l_a$ cannot coincide, they cannot be parallel.  Then $l$ and $l_b$ cannot be parallel either, so they intersect, contradiction. All possibilities have been exhausted, and thus we can conclude that two intersections is impossible.

It appears that $a_n=\\frac{3}{4n-1}$ , for all $n$ . Setting $n=2019$ , we find $a_{2019}=\\frac{3}{8075}$ , so the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) }8078}$ . To prove this formula, we use induction. We are given that $a_1=1$ and $a_2=\\frac{3}{7}$ , which satisfy our formula. Now assume the formula holds true for all $n\\le m$ for some positive integer $m$ . By our assumption, $a_{m-1}=\\frac{3}{4m-5}$ and $a_m=\\frac{3}{4m-1}$ .

We have $\\frac{1}{a_n} = \\frac{2a_{n-2}-a_{n-1}}{a_{n-2} \\cdot a_{n-1}}=\\frac{2}{a_{n-1}}-\\frac{1}{a_{n-2}}$ , in other words, $\\frac{1}{a_n}-\\frac{1}{a_{n-1}} = \\frac{1}{a_{n-1}}-\\frac{1}{a_{n-2}}$ . So $\\{\\frac{1}{a_n}\\}$ is an arithmetic sequence with step size $\\frac{7}{3}-1=\\frac{4}{3}$ , which means $\\frac{1}{a_{2019}} = 1+2018 \\cdot \\frac{4}{3} = \\frac{8075}{3}$ . Since the numerator and the denominator are relatively prime, the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) } 8078}$ . -eric2020 (modified by Dolphindesigner) It seems reasonable to transform the equation into something else. Let $a_{n}=x$ , $a_{n-1}=y$ , and $a_{n-2}=z$ . Therefore, we have \\[x=\\frac{zy}{2z-y}\\]  \\[2xz-xy=zy\\]  \\[2xz=y(x+z)\\]  \\[y=\\frac{2xz}{x+z}\\] Thus, $y$ is the harmonic mean of $x$ and $z$ . This implies $a_{n}$ is a harmonic sequence or equivalently $b_{n}=\\frac{1}{a_{n}}$ is arithmetic. Now, we have $b_{1}=1$ , $b_{2}=\\frac{7}{3}$ , $b_{3}=\\frac{11}{3}$ , and so on. Since the common difference is $\\frac{4}{3}$ , we can express $b_{n}$ explicitly as $b_{n}=\\frac{4}{3}(n-1)+1$ . This gives $b_{2019}=\\frac{4}{3}(2019-1)+1=\\frac{8075}{3}$ which implies $a_{2019}=\\frac{3}{8075}=\\frac{p}{q}$ . $p+q=\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) } 8078}$ ~jakeg314 Notice that \\[a_n = \\frac{1}{\\frac{2}{a_{n-1}} - \\frac{1}{a_{n-2}}}.\\] Therefore, \\[\\frac{1}{a_n} = \\frac{2}{a_{n-1}} - \\frac{1}{a_{n-2}}, \\ \\ \\implies \\ \\ \\frac{\\frac{1}{a_n} + \\frac{1}{a_{n-2}}}{2} = \\frac{1}{a_{n-1}}.\\] Therefore, the sequence $b_n = \\frac{1}{a_n}$ is an arithmetic sequence.

We can see the radius of the larger circle is $2\\overline{OH} + 1$ . Using $30^{\\circ}-60^{\\circ}-90^{\\circ}$ triangles, we know $\\overline{OH} = \\sqrt{3}$ . Therefore, the radius of the larger circle is $2\\sqrt{3}+1$ . The area of the larger circle is thus $\\left(2\\sqrt{3}+1\\right)^2 \\pi = \\left(13+4\\sqrt{3}\\right)\\pi$ , and the sum of the areas of the smaller circles is $13\\pi$ , so the area of the dark region is $\\left(13+4\\sqrt{3}\\right)\\pi-13\\pi = \\boxed{\\textbf{(A) } 4 \\pi \\sqrt{3}}$ .

      " We can expand the fraction $0.\\overline{23}_k$ as follows: $0.\\overline{23}_k = 2\\cdot k^{-1} + 3 \\cdot k^{-2} + 2 \\cdot k^{-3} + 3 \\cdot k^{-4} + \\cdots$  Notice that this is equivalent to \\[2( k^{-1} + k^{-3} + k^{-5} + ... ) + 3 (k^{-2} + k^{-4} + k^{-6} + \\cdots )\\]  By summing the geometric series and simplifying, we have $\\frac{2k+3}{k^2-1} = \\frac{7}{51}$ . Solving this quadratic equation (or simply testing the answer choices) yields the answer $k = \\boxed{\\textbf{(D) }16}$ . Let $a = 0.2323\\dots_k$ . Therefore, $k^2a=23.2323\\dots_k$ . From this, we see that $k^2a-a=23_k$ , so $a = \\frac{23_k}{k^2-1} = \\frac{2k+3}{k^2-1} = \\frac{7}{51}$ . Now, similar to in Solution 1, we can either test if $2k+3$ is a multiple of 7 with the answer choices, or actually solve the quadratic, so that the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) }16}$ . Just as in Solution 1, we arrive at the equation $\\frac{2k+3}{k^2-1}=\\frac{7}{51}$ . Therefore now, we can rewrite this as $\\frac{2k+3}{(k-1)(k+1)}=\\frac{7}{51}=\\frac{7}{3\\cdot 17}$ . Notice that $2k+3=2(k+1)+1=2(k-1)+5$ . As $17$ is a prime number, we therefore must have that one of $k-1$ and $k+1$ is divisible by $17$ . Now, checking each of the answer choices, this will lead us to the answer $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) }16}$ . Assuming you are familiar with the rules for basic repeating decimals, $0.232323... = \\frac{23}{99}$ . Now we want our base, $k$ , to conform to $23\\equiv7\\pmod k$ and $99\\equiv51\\pmod k$ , the reason being that we wish to convert the number from base $10$ to base $k$ . Given the first equation, we know that $k$ must equal 9, 16, 23, or generally, $7n+2$ . The only number in this set that is one of the multiple choices is $16$ . When we test this on the second equation, $99\\equiv51\\pmod k$ , it comes to be true. Therefore, our answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) }16}$ . Note that the LHS equals \\[\\bigg(\\frac{2}{k} + \\frac{2}{k^3} + \\cdots \\bigg) + \\bigg(\\frac{3}{k^2} + \\frac{3}{k^4} + \\cdots \\bigg) = \\frac{\\frac{2}{k}}{1 - \\frac{1}{k^2}} + \\frac{\\frac{3}{k^2}}{1 - \\frac{1}{k^2}} = \\frac{2k+3}{k^2-1},\\] from which we see our equation becomes \\[\\frac{2k+3}{k^2-1} = \\frac{7}{51}, \\ \\ \\implies \\ \\ 51(2k+3) = 7(k^2-1).\\]  Note that $17$ therefore divides $k^2 - 1,$ but as $17$ is prime this therefore implies \\[k \\equiv \\pm 1 \\pmod{17}.\\] (Warning: This would not be necessarily true if $17$ were composite.)

We need the two factors to yield a constant term of $4$ when multiplied together. The only combinations that work are $(x - [1 - i])$ and $(x - [2 + 2i])$ , or $(x - [1+i])$ and $(x - [2-2i])$ . When multiplied together, the polynomial is either $(x^2 + [-3 + i]x + 4)$ or $(x^2+[-3-i]x+4)$ . Therefore, $c = 3 \\pm i$ and $|c| = \\boxed{\\textbf{(E) } \\sqrt{10}}$ .\n",

      " Since $\\sqrt{\\log{a}}$ is a positive integer, we get $\\log a = x^2$ for some integer $x$ ; since $\\log \\sqrt{a} = \\tfrac 12 \\log a$ is a positive integer, we get $x=2m$ . Thus $a=10^{4m^2}$ ; similarly $b=10^{4n^2}$ . Substituting, we get $2(m+n+m^2+n^2)=100$ , i.e. $m(m+1) + n(n+1) = 50$ . It follows that $m,n \\le 6$ . The values of $m(m+1)$ for $m=1,\\ldots , 6$ are   $\\qquad m$  $1\\qquad$  $2\\qquad$  $3\\qquad$  $4\\qquad$  $5\\qquad$  $6\\qquad$    $m(m+1)\\qquad$   $2$   $6$   $12$   $20\\qquad$   $30$   $42$  Two of those values must add up to $50$ and we see that $20+30=50$ , so $m=4, n=5$ and $ab=10^{4(m^2+n^2)}=10^{4(4^2+5^2)}$ , and our answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) } 10^{164}}$ . Since all four terms on the left are positive integers, from $\\sqrt{\\log{a}}$ , we know that both $\\log{a}$ has to be a perfect square and $a$ has to be a power of ten. The same applies to $b$ for the same reason. Setting $a$ and $b$ to $10^x$ and $10^y$ , where $x$ and $y$ are the perfect squares, $ab = 10^{x+y}$ . By listing all the perfect squares up to $14^2$ (as $15^2$ is larger than the largest possible sum of $x$ and $y$ of $200$ from answer choice $\\text{E}$ ), two of those perfect squares must add up to one of the possible sums of $x$ and $y$ given from the answer choices ( $52$ , $100$ , $144$ , $164$ , or $200$ ). Only a few possible sums are seen: $16+36=52$ , $36+64=100$ , $64+100=164$ , $100+100=200$ , and $4+196=200$ . By testing each of these (seeing whether $\\sqrt{x} + \\sqrt{y} + \\frac{x}{2} + \\frac{y}{2} = 100$ ), only the pair $x = 64$ and $y=100$ work. Therefore, $a$ and $b$ are $10^{64}$ and $10^{100}$ , and our answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) } 10^{164}}$ . Given that $\\sqrt{\\log{a}}$ and $\\sqrt{\\log{b}}$ are both integers, $a$ and $b$ must be in the form $10^{m^2}$ and $10^{n^2}$ , respectively for some positive integers $m$ and $n$ . Note that $\\log \\sqrt{a} = \\frac{m^2}{2}$ . By substituting for a and b, the equation becomes $m + n + \\frac{m^2}{2} + \\frac{n^2}{2} = 100$ . After multiplying the equation by 2 and completing the square with respect to $m$ and $n$ , the equation becomes $(m + 1)^2 + (n + 1)^2 = 202$ . Testing squares of positive integers that add to $202$ , $11^2 + 9^2$ is the only option. Without loss of generality, let $m = 10$ and $n = 8$ . Plugging in $m$ and $n$ to solve for $a$ and $b$ gives us $a = 10^{100}$ and $b = 10^{64}$ . Therefore, $ab = \\boxed{\\textbf{(D) } 10^{164}}$ . https://youtu.be/U0jHAadc4MA  ~ Education, the Study of Everything   https://youtu.be/RdIIEhsbZKw?t=1250  ~ pi_is_3.14\n",

      " Solution 1 Note that odd sums can only be formed by $(e,e,o)$ or $(o,o,o),$ so we focus on placing the evens: we need to have each even be with another even in each row/column. Because there are only 5 odd numbers overall, we can only have 1 $(o,o,o)$ row and 1 $(o,o,o)$ column. It can be seen that there are $3 \\cdot 3 = 9$ ways to do this. There  are then $5!$ ways to permute the odd numbers, and $4!$ ways to permute the even numbers, thus giving the answer as $\\frac{9 \\cdot 5! \\cdot 4!}{9!}=\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }\\frac{1}{14}}$ . ~Petallstorm\n",
      "(Minor edits by JeffersonJ) Solution 2 (Pigeonhole) By the Pigeonhole Principle , there must be at least one row with $2$ or more odd numbers in it. Therefore, that row must contain $3$ odd numbers in order to have an odd sum. The same thing can be done with the columns. Thus we simply have to choose one row and one column to be filled with odd numbers, so the number of valid odd/even configurations (without regard to which particular odd and even  numbers are placed where) is $3 \\cdot 3 = 9$ . The denominator will be $\\binom{9}{4}$ , the total number of ways we could choose which $4$ of the $9$ squares will contain an even number. Hence the answer is \\[\\frac{9}{\\binom{9}{4}}=\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }\\frac{1}{14}}\\]  - The Pigeonhole Principle isn't really necessary here: After noting from the first solution that any row that contains evens must contain two evens, the result follows that the four evens must form the corners of a rectangle. ~Petallstorm Solution 3 Note that there are 5 odds and 4 evens, and for three numbers to sum an odd number, either 1 or three must be odd. Hence, one column must be all odd and one row must be all odd. First, we choose a row, for which there are three choices and within the row P(5,3). There are 3! ways to order the remaining odds and 4! ways to order the evens. The total possible ways is 9!. $\\frac{3 \\cdot P(5,3) \\cdot 3! \\cdot 4!}{9!}=\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }\\frac{1}{14}}$  ~Petallstorm Solution 4 Note that the odd sums are only formed by, $(O, O, O)$ or any permutation of $(O, E, E)$ . When looking at a 3x3 box, we realize that there must always be one column that is odd and one row that is odd. Calculating the probability of one permutation of this we get:   Odd - $\\frac{5}{9}$  Odd - $\\frac{4}{8}$  Odd - $\\frac{3}{7}$    Odd - $\\frac{2}{6}$  Even  Even   Odd - $\\frac{1}{5}$  Even  Even $\\frac{5!}{P(9,5)} = \\frac{5 \\cdot 4\\cdot 3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1}{9 \\cdot 8\\cdot 7 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 5} = \\frac{1}{126}$  Now, there are 9 ways you can get this particular permutation (3 choices for all odd row, 3 choices for all odd column), so multiplying the result by $9$ , we get: \\[\\frac{1}{126} \\cdot 9 = \\frac{9}{126} = \\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }\\frac{1}{14}}\\] ~petallstorm Solution 5 To get an odd sum we need $\\text{odd} + \\text{odd} + \\text{odd}$ or we need $\\text{odd} + \\text{even} + \\text{even}$ . Note that there are $9!$ ways to arrange the numbers. Also notice that there are $4$ even numbers and $5$ odd numbers from $1$ through $9$ . The number of ways to arrange the even numbers is $4!$ and the number of ways to arrange the odd numbers is $5!$ . Now a common strategy is to deal with the category with fewer numbers so this suggests for us to look at even numbers and try something out. Since we have $4$ even numbers we need to split two evens to one row and two evens to another row. Note that there are $\\tbinom{3}{2}$ ways to choose the rows, and the $\\tbinom{3}{2}$ to choose where the two even numbers go in that row. The odd numbers go wherever there is a spot left which means we don't need to care about them. So we totally have $9$ ways to place the even numbers. Don't forget, we still need to arrange these even and odd numbers and like mentioned above there are $4!$ and $5!$ ways respectively. Therefore our answer is simply \\[\\frac{5! \\cdot 4! \\cdot 9}{9!} = \\frac{1}{7\\cdot 2} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{14}}.\\]  Solution 6 We need to know the number of successful outcomes/Total outcomes. We start by the total number of ways to place the odd numbers, which is $\\binom{9}{5}$ , which is because there are $5$ odd number between $1$ and $9$ . Note we need $1$ odd number and $2$ even numbers OR $3$ odd numbers in each row to satisfy our conditions. We have $3$ types of arrangements for the number of successful outcomes, we could have all the even numbers on the corners, which is $1$ case, We could have the odd numbers arranged like a T, which has $4$ cases (you could twist them around), and you have the even numbers in a $2$ by $2$ square, and you have $4$ cases for that. We have $9$ successful cases and $126$ total cases, so the probability is $\\frac{9}{126}$ = $\\frac{1}{14}$ which is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }\\frac{1}{14}}$  ~Arcticturn Solution 7 Since we only care about the parity of the sum of our rows and columns, let's take everything modulo $2$ . We can see that there will be $5$ odd numbers, and $4$ even numbers. Testing a few configurations, we realize that if we have one complete row and column of $1 \\text{s}$ , the sum of all rows and columns will be odd. We find $3$ distinct configurations: \\[\\begin{tabular}{ |c|c|c| }  \\hline 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\  \\hline 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\  \\hline 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\  \\hline \\end{tabular} \\ \\ \\ \\ \\begin{tabular}{ |c|c|c| }  \\hline 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\  \\hline 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\  \\hline 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\  \\hline \\end{tabular} \\ \\ \\ \\ \\begin{tabular}{ |c|c|c| }  \\hline 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\  \\hline 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\  \\hline 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\  \\hline \\end{tabular}\\] We can see that rotating the first configuration by $90^{\\circ}, 180^{\\circ}, 270^{\\circ},$ and $360^{\\circ}$ , will give us $4$ cases for this configuration. Similarly, the second configuration has $4$ cases by the same rotations. The third configuration only has $1$ case because its rotational symmetry is $90^{\\circ}$ . There are $5! \\cdot 4!$ ways to choose the odd and even numbers for all of the configurations, so our answer is $\\frac{(4+4+1)(5!\\cdot 4!)}{9!}=\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }\\frac{1}{14}}$ . $\\textbf{Note:}$ We can also realize that there are $9$ places for the row and column of $1 \\text{s}$ to overlap, resulting in $9$ cases for all of the possible configurations. ~kn07 https://youtu.be/IRyWOZQMTV8?t=2069  ~ pi_is_3.14 Video Solution 1 https://youtu.be/meWXF5pPdlI  Education, the Study of Everything Video Solution 2 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJgS-q3-1JE  Video Solution 3 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Sj7XPernCY  Video Solution 4 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APKGHtj-2rI \n",

Let $p, q$ , and $r$ be the roots of the polynomial. Then, $p^3 - 5p^2 + 8p - 13 = 0$  $q^3 - 5q^2 + 8q - 13 = 0$  $r^3 - 5r^2 + 8r - 13 = 0$  Adding these three equations, we get $(p^3 + q^3 + r^3) - 5(p^2 + q^2 + r^2) + 8(p + q + r) - 39 = 0$  $s_3 - 5s_2 + 8s_1 = 39$  $39$ can be written as $13s_0$ , giving $s_3 = 5s_2 - 8s_1 + 13s_0$  We are given that $s_{k+1} = a \\, s_k + b \\, s_{k-1} + c \\, s_{k-2}$ is satisfied for $k = 2$ , $3$ , $....$ , meaning it must be satisfied when $k = 2$ , giving us $s_3 = a \\, s_2 + b \\, s_1 + c \\, s_0$ . Therefore, $a = 5, b = -8$ , and $c = 13$ by matching coefficients. $5 - 8 + 13 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(D) } 10}$ . Let $p, q$ , and $r$ be the roots of the polynomial.

We have \\[\\begin{split} 5s_k + 13s_{k-2} &= s_{k+1} + (p^k q + p^k r + p^{k-1}qr) + (pq^k + pq^{k-1}r + q^k r) + (pqr^{k-1} + pr^k + qr^k) \\\\ &= s_{k+1} + p^{k-1} (pq + pr + qr) + q^{k-1} (pq + pr + qr) + r^{k-1} (pq + pr + qr) \\\\ &= s_{k+1} + (p^{k-1} + q^{k-1} + r^{k-1})(pq + pr + qr) \\\\ &= 5s_k + 13s_{k-2} = s_{k+1} + 8s_{k-1}\\end{split}\\]  Rearrange to get $s_{k+1} = 5s_k - 8s_{k-1} + 13s_{k-2}$  So, $a+ b + c = 5 -8 + 13 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(D) } 10}$ . -gregwwl Let $r,s,t$ be the roots of $x^3-5x^2+8x-13$ . Then: $r^3=5r^2-8r+13$  \\  $s^3=5s^2-8s+13$  \\  $t^3=5t^2-8t+13$  If we multiply both sides of the equation by $r^k$ , where $k$ is a positive integer, then that won't change the coefficients, but just the degree of the new polynomial and the other term's exponents. We can try multiplying to find $r^4+s^4+t^4$ , but that is just to check. So then with the above information about $r^3,s^3,t^3$ , we see that: $r^k=5r^{k-1}-8r^{k-2}-13r^{k-3}$ , $s^k=5s^{k-1}-8s^{k-2}-13s^{k-3}$ , $t^k=5t^{k-1}-8t^{k-2}-13t^{k-3}$  $s_k=r^k+s^k+t^k$  Then: $s_k=5s_{k-1}-8s_{k-2}+13s_{k-3}$  This means that $s_{k+1}=5s_{k}-8s_{k-1}+13s_{k-2}$ , as expected.

      " The triangle is placed on the sphere so that its three sides are tangent to the sphere. The cross-section of the sphere created by the plane of the triangle is also the incircle of the triangle. To find the inradius, use $\\text{area} = \\text{inradius} \\cdot \\text{semiperimeter}$ . The area of the triangle can be found by drawing an altitude from the vertex between sides with length $15$ to the midpoint of the side with length $24$ . The Pythagorean triple $9$ - $12$ - $15$ allows us easily to determine that the base is $24$ and the height is $9$ . The formula $\\frac {\\text{base} \\cdot \\text{height}} {2}$ can also be used to find the area of the triangle as $108$ , while the semiperimeter is simply $\\frac {15 + 15 + 24} {2} = 27$ . After plugging into the equation, we thus get $108 = \\text{inradius} \\cdot 27$ , so the inradius is $4$ . Now, let the distance between $O$ and the triangle be $x$ . Choose a point on the incircle and denote it by $A$ . The distance $OA$ is $6$ , because it is just the radius of the sphere. The distance from point $A$ to the center of the incircle is $4$ , because it is the radius of the incircle. By using the Pythagorean Theorem, we thus find $x = \\sqrt{6^2-4^2}=\\sqrt{20} = \\boxed{\\textbf {(D) } 2 \\sqrt {5}}$ . Drop an altitude on the isosceles triangle. Let the resulting 3-4-5 right triangle $ABC$ have $AB=15$ and $BC=12$ . By special triangle, $AC=9$ . Let $r$ be the circle's radius. Let the circle's center be $O$ and $D$ be the closest point on $AB$ to $O$ . Then, $OD=r$ . Obviously, $ODBC$ is a kite. Thus, $BC=DB=12$ , and $AD=15-DB=3$ . $AO=AC-r=9-r$ . By Pythagoras, $AD^2+OD^2=AO^2$ , so $3^2+r^2=(9-r)^2$ . The $r^2$ terms cancel out, and $r=4$ .

Recall that the inradius is the intersection of the angle bisectors. To find the inradius of the incircle, we use the Angle Bisector Theorem.

By the Pythagorean Theorem, $CH=\\sqrt{256x^2-121x^2}=3x\\sqrt{15}$ and $CH=\\sqrt{64y^2-49y^2}=y\\sqrt{15}$ . Thus, $y=3x$ . The sides of the triangle are then $16x$ , $11x+7(3x)=32x$ , and $24x$ , so for some integers $a,b$ , $16x=a$ and $24x=b$ , where $a$ and $b$ are minimal. Hence, $\\frac{a}{16}=\\frac{b}{24}$ , or $3a=2b$ . Thus the smallest possible positive integers $a$ and $b$ that satisfy this are $a=2$ and $b=3$ , so $x=\\frac{1}{8}$ . The sides of the triangle are $2$ , $3$ , and $4$ , so $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A) } 9}$ is our answer.

By some trial and error, we get that $(a,b,c) = (3,2,4)$ . Checking to see that this fits the triangle inequality, we find out that this indeed works.

Each case has a $\\frac{1}{4}$ chance of occurring (as it requires two coin flips). For Case 1, we need $x$ and $y$ to be different. Therefore, the probability for success in Case 1 is $\\frac{1}{2}$ . For Case 2, if $x$ is 0, we need $y$ to be in the interval $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}, 1\\right]$ . If $x$ is 1, we need $y$ to be in the interval $\\left[0, \\frac{1}{2}\\right)$ . Regardless of what $x$ is, the probability for success for Case 2 is $\\frac{1}{2}$ . By symmetry, Case 3 has the same success rate as Case 2. For Case 4, we must use geometric probability because there are an infinite number of pairs $(x, y)$ that can be selected, whether they satisfy the inequality or not. Graphing $|x-y| > \\tfrac{1}{2}$ gives us the following picture where the shaded area is the set of all the points that fulfill the inequality: [asy] filldraw((0,0)--(0,1)--(1/2,1)--(0,1/2)--cycle,black+linewidth(1)); filldraw((0,0)--(1,0)--(1,1/2)--(1/2,0)--cycle,black+linewidth(1)); draw((0,0)--(0,1)--(1,1)--(1,0)--cycle); [/asy]  The shaded area is $\\frac{1}{4}$ , which means the probability for success for case 4 is $\\frac{1}{4}$ (since the total area of the bounding square, containing all possible pairs, is $1$ ). Adding up the success rates from each case, we get: $\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4}\\right) = \\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }\\frac{7}{16}}$ .  Taking into account that there are two options for the result of the first coin flip, there are four possible combinations with equal possibility of initial coins flips. (1) x: heads, y: heads (2) x: heads, y: tails (3) x: tails, y: heads (4) x: tails, y: tails (1) Because x and y both must be integers, so it's simple to see that the probability that $|x-y| > \\tfrac{1}{2}$ is $\\frac{1}{2}$ . (2) Since x has to be an integer it is also easy to see that the probability is again $\\frac{1}{2}$ . (3) This is the same as case 2 so the probability is $\\frac{1}{2}$ . (4) This one is a little bit tricky. You could use geometric probability shown above, but if you don't understand it or happened to not think of it, there is another solution that involves using the multiple choice answers. First, the probability we have so far is $\\frac{3}{8}$ .This is greater than $\\frac{1}{3}$ so $A$ is the not the answer. It is either $B, C, D,$ or $E$ . Let's draw out the probability with two parallel lines on a paper with represent a number line from $0-1$ . The concept is to compare one point and find the fraction of the other line that contains points that are at least $\\frac{1}{2}$ away from it. If the point we choose is on the endpoints, then the fraction of the other line that works is exactly $\\frac{1}{2}$ . But as we move this point closer to the middle, the deadzone (area where the other point cannot be) grows, diminishing the probability. Finally, when it is directly in the middle, there are no points that pass the requirements except at $1$ and $0$ . So, looking at the choices again, we have $\\frac{7}{16}$ , $\\frac{1}{2}$ , $\\frac{9}{16}$ , and $\\frac{2}{3}$ . $\\frac{1}{2}$ is exactly $\\frac{1}{8}$ more than the probability we had before. Notice that this is impossible because we proved that the average probability of the fourth case is lower than $\\frac{1}{2}$ , so the answer is $\\boxed{B}$ . -jackshi2006 First, calculate the conditional probabilities: $P(x\\in[0,\\frac{1}{2}) \\mid x\\in[0,1]) = \\frac{1}{2}$ , $P(|x-y|>\\frac{1}{2} \\mid x\\in[0,1], y=1) = \\frac{1}{2}$  $P(x\\in(\\frac{1}{2},1] \\mid x\\in[0,1]) = \\frac{1}{2}$ , $P(|x-y|>\\frac{1}{2} \\mid x\\in[0,1], y=0) = \\frac{1}{2}$  $P(y\\in[0,\\frac{1}{2}) \\mid y\\in[0,1]) = \\frac{1}{2}$ , $P(|x-y|>\\frac{1}{2} \\mid x=1, y\\in[0,1]) = \\frac{1}{2}$  $P(y\\in(\\frac{1}{2},1] \\mid y\\in[0,1]) = \\frac{1}{2}$ , $P(|x-y|>\\frac{1}{2} \\mid x=0, y\\in[0,1]) = \\frac{1}{2}$  As stated in Solution 1, $P(|x-y|>\\frac{1}{2} \\mid x\\in[0,1], y\\in[0,1]) = \\frac{1}{4}$  Next, calculate the dependent event probabilities by $P(A \\cap B)= P(A \\mid B) \\cdot P(B)$ , draw a table to calculate $P(|x-y|>\\frac{1}{2})$ by the dependent events: \\[ \\begin{array}[b]{cccc}  & P(x=0)=\\frac{1}{4} & P(x=1)=\\frac{1}{4} & P(x \\in [0,1])=\\frac{1}{2} \\\\  &  &  &  \\\\ P(y=0)=\\frac{1}{4} & 0 & \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{16} & \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{16} \\\\  &  &  &  \\\\ P(y=1)=\\frac{1}{4} & \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{16} & 0 & \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{16} \\\\  &  &  &  \\\\ P(y \\in [0,1])=\\frac{1}{2} & \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{16} & \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{16} & \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{16}  \\end{array} \\]  The sum of all the cell values is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B)}\\frac{7}{16}}$  ~ isabelchen  Notice the probability that $|x-y| > \\tfrac{1}{2}$ is equal to $2$ times the probability that $x-y > \\tfrac{1}{2}$ .

Case $1$ : $x$ flips $T$ and $y$ flips $T$  When $x$ flips $T$ and $y$ flips $T$ , both $x$ and $y$ are randomly chosen from the interval $[0,1]$ .

The probability that $x-y > \\tfrac{1}{2}$ when $x=1$ , and $y$ is randomly chosen from the interval $[0,1]$ is $\\frac12$ ( $y$ has to be between $[0,\\frac12]$ ). Therefore, the probability for Case $2$ is $\\frac12 \\cdot \\frac12 \\cdot \\frac12 \\cdot \\frac12 = \\frac{1}{16}$  Case $3$ : $x$ flips $T$ and $y$ flips $HH$  When $x$ flips $T$ and $y$ flips $HH$ , $x$ is randomly chosen from the interval $[0,1]$ , and $y = 0$ . The probability that $x-y > \\tfrac{1}{2}$ when $x$ is randomly chosen from the interval $[0,1]$ , and $y = 0$ is $\\frac12$ ( $x$ has to be between $[\\frac12,1]$ ). Therefore, the probability for Case $3$ is $\\frac12 \\cdot \\frac12 \\cdot \\frac12 \\cdot \\frac12 = \\frac{1}{16}$  Case $4$ : $x$ flips $HT$ and $y$ flips $HH$  When $x$ flips $HT$ and $y$ flips $HH$ , $x=1$ , and $y = 0$ . The probability that $x-y > \\frac{1}{2}$ when $x=1$ , and $y = 0$ is $1$ . Therefore, the probability for Case $4$ is $\\frac12 \\cdot \\frac12 \\cdot \\frac12 \\cdot \\frac12 \\cdot 1= \\frac{1}{16}$  Hence, the answer is $2(\\frac{1}{32} + \\frac{1}{16} + \\frac{1}{16} + \\frac{1}{16}) = \\boxed{\\textbf{(B)}\\frac{7}{16}}$  ~ isabelchen  https://youtu.be/wimynTAVIx8  Education, the Study of Everything https://youtu.be/ZhAZ1oPe5Ds?t=263  ~ pi_is_3.14 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe5bDwSzsOs \n",

      " By definition, the recursion becomes $a_n = \\left(n^{\\frac1{\\log_7(n-1)}}\\right)^{\\log_7(a_{n-1})}=n^{\\frac{\\log_7(a_{n-1})}{\\log_7(n-1)}}$ .  By the change of base formula, this reduces to $a_n = n^{\\log_{n-1}(a_{n-1})}$ .  Thus, we have $\\log_n(a_n) = \\log_{n-1}(a_{n-1})$ .  Thus, for each positive integer $m \\geq 3$ , the value of $\\log_m(a_m)$ must be some constant value $k$ . We now compute $k$ from $a_3$ .  It is given that $a_3 = 3\\,\\heartsuit\\,2 = 3^{\\frac1{\\log_7(2)}}$ , so $k = \\log_3(a_3) = \\log_3\\left(3^{\\frac1{\\log_7(2)}}\\right) = \\frac1{\\log_7(2)} = \\log_2(7)$ . Now, we must have $\\log_{2019}(a_{2019}) = k = \\log_2(7)$ . At this point, we simply switch some bases around. For those who are unfamiliar with logarithms, we can turn the logarithms into fractions which are less intimidating to work with. $\\frac{\\log{a_{2019}}}{\\log{2019}} = \\frac{\\log{7}}{\\log{2}}\\implies \\frac{\\log{a_{2019}}}{\\log{7}} = \\frac{\\log{2019}}{\\log{2}}\\implies \\log_7(a_{2019}) =\\log_2(2019)$  We conclude that $\\log_7(a_{2019}) = \\log_2(2019) \\approx \\boxed{11}$ , or choice $\\boxed{\\text{D}}$ .

Using logarithm rules, we can remove the exponent of the 3 so that $k = \\frac{\\log_{7}(3)}{\\log_{7}(2)}$ . Therefore, $a_4 = 4^{\\frac{1}{\\log_{7}(2)}}$ , which is $4  \\, \\heartsuit \\, 2$ . We claim that $a_n = n  \\, \\heartsuit \\, 2$ for all $n \\geq 3$ . We can prove this through induction. Clearly, the base case where $n = 3$ holds. $a_n = (n\\, \\heartsuit\\, (n-1)) \\,\\diamondsuit\\, ((n-1)  \\, \\heartsuit \\, 2)$  This can be simplified as $a_n = (n^{\\log_{n-1}(7)}) \\, \\diamondsuit \\, ((n-1)^{\\log_{2}(7)})$ . Applying the diamond operation, we can simplify $a_n = n^h$ where $h = \\log_{n-1}(7) \\cdot \\log_{7}(n-1)^{\\log_{2}(7)}$ . By using logarithm rules to remove the exponent of $\\log_{7}(n-1)$ and after cancelling, $h = \\frac{1}{\\log_{7}(2)}$ .

      " The main insight is that \\[\\frac{(n^2)!}{(n!)^{n+1}}\\]  is always an integer. This is true because it is precisely the number of ways to split up $n^2$ objects into $n$ unordered groups of size $n$ . Thus, \\[\\frac{(n^2-1)!}{(n!)^n}=\\frac{(n^2)!}{(n!)^{n+1}}\\cdot\\frac{n!}{n^2}\\]  is an integer if $n^2 \\mid n!$ , or in other words, if $\\frac{(n-1)!}{n}$ , is an integer. This condition is false precisely when $n=4$ or $n$ is prime, by Wilson's Theorem . There are $15$ primes between $1$ and $50$ , inclusive, so there are $15 + 1 = 16$ terms for which \\[\\frac{(n^2-1)!}{(n!)^{n}}\\]  is potentially not an integer. It can be easily verified that the above expression is not an integer for $n=4$ as there are more factors of $2$ in the denominator than the numerator. Similarly, it can be verified that the above expression is not an integer for any prime $n=p$ , as there are more factors of p in the denominator than the numerator. Thus all $16$ values of n make the expression not an integer and the answer is $50-16=\\boxed{\\textbf{(D)}\\ 34}$ . SideNote: Another method to prove that \\[\\frac{(n^2)!}{(n!)^{n+1}}\\] is always an integer is instead as follows using Number Theory. Notice that $n$ will divide the numerator $n+1$ times, since $n^2 = n \\times n$ contains not one but two factors of $n.$ Also, for $a < n,$ notice that $a$ divides $(n^2)!$ at least \\[\\lfloor \\frac{n^2}{a} \\rfloor \\ge \\lfloor \\frac{n^2}{n-1} \\rfloor \\ge \\lfloor \\frac{n^2 - 1}{n-1} \\rfloor \\ge n+1\\] times. Thus, each integer from $1$ to $n$ will divide $(n^2)!$ at least $n+1$ times, which proves such a lemma. $\\square{}$  We can use the P-Adic Valuation (more info could be found here: Mathematicial notation ) of n to solve this problem (recall the P-Adic Valuation of 'n' is denoted by $v_p (n)$ and is defined as the greatest power of some prime 'p' that divides n. For example, $v_2 (6)=1$ or $v_7 (245)=2$ .) Using Legendre's formula, we know that : \\[v_p (n!)= \\sum_{i=1}^\\infty   \\lfloor \\frac {n}{p^i} \\rfloor\\]  Seeing factorials involved in the problem, this prompts us to use Legendre's Formula where n is a power of a prime. We also know that , $v_p (m^n) = n \\cdot v_p (m)$ .\n",
      "Knowing that $a\\mid b$ if $v_p (a) \\le v_p (b)$ , we have that : \\[n \\cdot v_p (n!) \\le v_p ((n^2 -1 )!)\\] and we must find all n for which this is true. If we plug in $n=p$ , by Legendre's we get two equations: \\[v_p ((n^2 -1)!) = \\sum_{i=1}^\\infty  \\lfloor \\frac {n^2 -1}{p^i} \\rfloor = (p-1)+0+...+0 = p-1\\]  And we also get : \\[v_p ((n!)^n) = n \\cdot v_p (n!)= n \\cdot \\sum_{i=1}^\\infty   \\lfloor \\frac {n}{p^i} \\rfloor = p \\cdot ( 1+0+...0) = p\\]  But we are asked to prove that $n \\cdot v_p (n!) \\le v_p ((n^2 -1 )!) \\Longrightarrow p \\le p-1$ which is false for all 'n' where n is prime. Now we try the same for $n=p^2$ , where p is a prime. By Legendre we arrive at: \\[v_p ((p^4 -1)!) = p^3 + p^2 + p -3\\]  (as $v_p(p^4!) = p^3 + p^2 + p + 1$ and $p^4$ contains 4 factors of $p$ ) and \\[p^2 \\cdot v_p (p^2 !) = p^3 + p^2\\]  Then we get: \\[p^2 \\cdot v_p (p!) \\le v_p ((n^4 -1)!) \\Longrightarrow p^3 + p^2 \\le p^3 + p^2 + p -3\\] Which is true for all primes except for 2, so $2^2 = 4$ doesn't work. It can easily be verified that for all $n=p^i$ where $i$ is an integer greater than 2, satisfies the inequality : \\[n \\cdot v_p (n!) \\le v_p ((n^2 -1 )!).\\]  Therefore, there are 16 values that don't work and $50-16 = \\boxed{\\mathbf{(D)}\\ 34}$ values that work. ~qwertysri987 Notice all $15$ primes don't work as there are $n$ factors of $n$ in the denominator and $n-1$ factors of $n$ in the numerator. Further experimentation finds that $n=4$ does not work as there are 11 factors of 2 in the numerator and 12 in the denominator. We also find that it seems that all other values of $n$ work. So we get $50-15-1=\\boxed{34}$ and that happens to be right. ~ BS2012 \n",

      " For all nonnegative integers $n$ , let $\\angle C_nA_nB_n=x_n$ , $\\angle A_nB_nC_n=y_n$ , and $\\angle B_nC_nA_n=z_n$ . Note that quadrilateral $A_0B_0A_1B_1$ is cyclic since $\\angle A_0A_1B_0=\\angle A_0B_1B_0=90^\\circ$ ; thus, $\\angle A_0A_1B_1=\\angle A_0B_0B_1=90^\\circ-x_0$ . By a similar argument, $\\angle A_0A_1C_1=\\angle A_0C_0C_1=90^\\circ-x_0$ . Thus, $x_1=\\angle A_0A_1B_1+\\angle A_0A_1C_1=180^\\circ-2x_0$ . By a similar argument, $y_1=180^\\circ-2y_0$ and $z_1=180^\\circ-2z_0$ . Therefore, for any positive integer $n$ , we have $x_n=180^\\circ-2x_{n-1}$ (identical recurrence relations can be derived for $y_n$ and $z_n$ ). To find an explicit form for this recurrence, we guess that the constant term is related exponentially to $n$ (and the coefficient of $x_0$ is $(-2)^n$ ). Hence, we let $x_n=pq^n+r+(-2)^nx_0$ . We will solve for $p$ , $q$ , and $r$ by iterating the recurrence to obtain $x_1=180^\\circ-2x_0$ , $x_2=4x_0-180^\\circ$ , and $x_3=540-8x_0$ . Letting $n=1,2,3$ respectively, we have \\begin{align} pq+r&=180 \\\\ pq^2+r&=-180 \\\\ pq^3+r&=540 \\end{align}  Subtracting $(1)$ from $(3)$ , we have $pq(q^2-1)=360$ , and subtracting $(1)$ from $(2)$ gives $pq(q-1)=-360$ . Dividing these two equations gives $q+1=-1$ , so $q=-2$ . Substituting back, we get $p=-60$ and $r=60$ . We will now prove that for all positive integers $n$ , $x_n=-60(-2)^n+60+(-2)^nx_0=(-2)^n(x_0-60)+60$ via induction. Clearly the base case of $n=1$ holds, so it is left to prove that $x_{n+1}=(-2)^{n+1}(x_0-60)+60$ assuming our inductive hypothesis holds for $n$ . Using the recurrence relation, we have \\begin{align*} x_{n+1}&=180-2x_n \\\\ &=180-2((-2)^n(x_0-60)+60) \\\\ &=(-2)^{n+1}(x_0-60)+60 \\end{align*}  Our induction is complete, so for all positive integers $n$ , $x_n=(-2)^n(x_0-60)+60$ . Identical equalities hold for $y_n$ and $z_n$ . The problem asks for the smallest $n$ such that either $x_n$ , $y_n$ , or $z_n$ is greater than $90^\\circ$ . WLOG, let $x_0=60^\\circ$ , $y_0=59.999^\\circ$ , and $z_0=60.001^\\circ$ . Thus, $x_n=60^\\circ$ for all $n$ , $y_n=-(-2)^n(0.001)+60$ , and $z_n=(-2)^n(0.001)+60$ . Solving for the smallest possible value of $n$ in each sequence, we find that $n=15$ gives $y_n>90^\\circ$ . Therefore, the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) } 15}$ . We start from Solution 1 until we reach the recurrence relation $x_n = 180 - 2x_{n - 1}.$ Iterate this again, to get $x_{n - 1} = 180 - 2x_{n - 2}.$ Subtract the two, getting $x_{n} = -x_{n - 1} + 2x_{n - 2}.$ This recurrence has characteristic equation $x^2 + x - 2 = 0 = (x + 2)(x - 1) = 0 \\iff x = -2, 1.$ Now, write \\[x_n = p + q \\cdot (-2)^n.\\] We obtain similar recursions for $y, z$ that can be easily solved by getting $x_1, y_1, z_1$ from the original recursive formula and then using those two values to solve for $p$ and $q.$ Then proceed with the last paragraph of Solution 1. We note that the problem seems quite complicated, but since it is an AMC 12, the difference between the largest angle of $\\triangle A_nB_nC_n$ and $60^{\\circ}$ (we call this quantity S) most likely reduces to a simpler problem like some repeating sequence. The only obvious sequence (for the answer choices) is a geometric sequence with an integer common ratio. From here, we get that $S_n=0.001S^n$ and we need $S_n>30$ . The first power of two greater than $30,000$ is $2^{15}$ thus our answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) } 15}$ . ~Dhillonr25 Video Solution by Richard Rusczyk https://artofproblemsolving.com/videos/amc/2019amc12a/497  ~ dolphin7\n",

      " Notice that whatever point we pick for $C$ , $AB$ will be the base of the triangle. Without loss of generality, let points $A$ and $B$ be $(0,0)$ and $(10,0)$ , since for any other combination of points, we can just rotate the plane to make them $(0,0)$ and $(10,0)$ under a new coordinate system. When we pick point $C$ , we have to make sure that its $y$ -coordinate is $\\pm20$ , because that's the only way the area of the triangle can be $100$ . Now when the perimeter is minimized, by symmetry, we put $C$ in the middle, at $(5, 20)$ . We can easily see that $AC$ and $BC$ will both be $\\sqrt{20^2+5^2} = \\sqrt{425}$ . The perimeter of this minimal triangle is $2\\sqrt{425} + 10$ , which is larger than $50$ . Since the minimum perimeter is greater than $50$ , there is no triangle that satisfies the condition, giving us $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A) }0}$ . ~IronicNinja Without loss of generality, let $AB$ be a horizontal segment of length $10$ . Now realize that $C$ has to lie on one of the lines parallel to $AB$ and vertically $20$ units away from it. But $10+20+20$ is already 50, and this doesn't form a triangle. Otherwise, without loss of generality, $AC<20$ . Dropping altitude $CD$ , we have a right triangle $ACD$ with hypotenuse $AC<20$ and leg $CD=20$ , which is clearly impossible, again giving the answer as $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A) }0}$ . We have: 1. Area = $100$  2. Perimeter = $50$  3. Semiperimeter $s = 50 \\div 2 = 25$  We let: 1. $z = \\overline{AB} = 10$  2. $x = \\overline{AC}$  3. $y = 50-10-x = 40-x$ . Heron's formula states that for real numbers $x$ , $y$ , $z$ , and semiperimeter $s$ , the area is $\\sqrt{(s)(s-x)(s-y)(s-z)}$ . Plugging numbers in, we have $100 = \\sqrt{(25)(25-10)(25-x)(25-(40-x))} = \\sqrt{(375)(25-x)(x-15)}$ .

Thus, there are no real solutions. First, let's assume that A and B are $(-5,0)$ and $(5,0)$ respectively. The graph of \"the perimeter is $50$ \" means that $\\overline{AC}+\\overline{BC}=50-10=40$ . So this is the graph of an ellipse (memorize that!).

We can also figure out the endpoints of the minor axis must have a y-coordinate less than $20$ . It is actually $\\sqrt{395}$ . Now, we consider \"the area is $100$ \". Since the base has length $10$ , then the height must have length $20$ . So the graph of \"the area is 100\" is $2$ lines, one at $y=20$ and the other at $y=-20$ . However, this graph does NOT intersect the ellipse, as $\\sqrt{395} < 20$ .

We now calculate the probability that a randomly-selected second edge makes the pair satisfy the condition in the problem statement. For two lines in space to determine a common plane, they must either intersect or be parallel (in other words, they cannot be skew lines). If all $12$ line segments are extended to lines, the first (arbitrarily chosen) edge's line intersects $4$ lines and is parallel to another $3$ . Thus $4+3=7$ of the $12-1=11$ remaining line segments (which could be chosen for the second edge) give a pair of lines determining a common plane. To see this, observe that in the diagram below, the red edge is parallel to the $3$ green edges and intersects with the $4$ blue edges.

Thus the answer is $\\frac{7}{11} \\cdot 66 =\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) }42}$ . As in Solution 1, we observe that the two edges must either be parallel or intersect. Clearly the edges will intersect if and only if they are part of the same face. We can thus divide into two cases: Case 1 : The two edges are part of the same face. There are $6$ faces, and ${4 \\choose 2}=6$ ways to choose $2$ of the $4$ edges of the square, giving a total of $6 \\cdot 6 = 36$ possibilities. Case 2 : The two edges are parallel and not part of the same face. Observe that each of the $12$ edges is parallel to exactly $1$ edge that is not part of its face. The edges can thus be paired up, giving $\\frac{12}{2} = 6$ possibilities for this case. Adding the two cases, the answer is hence $36 + 6 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(D) }42}$ . As in solution 1, we see that for an arbitrary edge of the cube, only $7$ of the other edges can be chosen to form a plane. For each of the $12$ edges, this gives $(7)(12) = 84$ total possible pairings. However each pair has been counted twice (e.g edge $A$ with $B$ , and edge $B$ with $A$ ) so we divide by 2 to get $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) }42}$ .\n",

Thus, by the addition formulae for $\\sin$ and $\\cos$ , we have \\[\\begin{split}\\sin{\\left(\\angle BAD\\right)}&=\\sin{\\left(\\angle BAC + \\angle CAD\\right)}\\\\&=\\sin{\\left(\\angle BAC\\right)}\\cos{\\left(\\angle CAD\\right)}+\\cos{\\left(\\angle BAC\\right)}\\sin{\\left(\\angle CAD\\right)}\\\\&=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\cdot\\frac{2 \\sqrt{2}}{3} + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{3} \\\\ &= \\frac{2 \\sqrt{2} + 1}{3 \\sqrt{2}}\\end{split}\\] and \\[\\begin{split}\\cos{\\left(\\angle BAD\\right)}&=\\cos{\\left(\\angle BAC + \\angle CAD\\right)}\\\\&=\\cos{\\left(\\angle BAC\\right)}\\cos{\\left(\\angle CAD\\right)}-\\sin{\\left(\\angle BAC\\right)}\\sin{\\left(\\angle CAD\\right)}\\\\&=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\cdot\\frac{2 \\sqrt{2}}{3} - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{3} \\\\ &= \\frac{2 \\sqrt{2} - 1}{3 \\sqrt{2}}\\end{split}\\]  Hence, by the double angle formula for $\\sin$ , $\\sin{\\left(2\\angle BAD\\right)} = 2\\sin{\\left(\\angle BAD\\right)}\\cos{\\left(\\angle BAD\\right)} = \\frac{2(8-1)}{18} = \\boxed{\\textbf{(D) } \\frac{7}{9}}$ . Solution 2 (coordinate geometry) We use the Pythagorean Theorem, as in Solution 1, to find $AD=\\frac{3}{2}$ and $CD=\\frac{1}{2}$ . Now notice that the angle between $CD$ and the vertical (i.e. the $y$ -axis) is $45^{\\circ}$ – to see this, drop a perpendicular from $D$ to $BA$ which meets $BA$ at $E$ , and use the fact that the angle sum of quadrilateral $CBED$ must be $360^{\\circ}$ . Anyway, this implies that the line $CD$ has slope $1$ , so since $C$ is the point $(0,1)$ and the length of $CD$ is $\\frac{1}{2}$ , $D$ has coordinates $\\left(0+\\frac{\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)}{\\sqrt{2}}, 1+\\frac{\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{2}}, 1+\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{2}}\\right)$ . Thus we have the lengths $DE=1+\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{2}}$ (it is just the $y$ -coordinate) and $AE = 1-\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{2}}$ . By simple trigonometry in $\\triangle DAE$ , we now find \\[\\sin{\\left(\\angle BAD\\right)} = \\frac{\\left(1+\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{2}}\\right)}{\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)} = \\frac{\\left(2+\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)}{3} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{2}+1}{3\\sqrt{2}}\\] and \\[\\cos{\\left(\\angle BAD\\right)} = \\frac{\\left(1-\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{2}}\\right)}{\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right)} = \\frac{\\left(2-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)}{3} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{2}-1}{3\\sqrt{2}}\\] just as before. We can then use the double angle formula (as in Solution 1) to deduce $\\sin{\\left(2\\angle BAD\\right)} = \\boxed{\\textbf{(D) } \\frac{7}{9}}$ . Solution 3 (easier finish to Solution 1) Again, use Pythagorean Theorem to find that $AD=\\frac{3}{2}$ and $CD=\\frac{1}{2}$ . Let $\\angle DAC=\\theta$ . Note that we want \\[\\sin{(90+2\\theta)}=\\cos{2\\theta}\\] which is easy to compute: \\[\\cos{\\theta}=\\frac{2\\sqrt{2}}{3}\\implies \\cos{2\\theta}=2(\\frac{8}{9})-1= \\boxed{\\textbf{(D) } \\frac{7}{9}}\\]  https://youtu.be/Cx2OmVoFGsw  ~ Education, the Study of Everything\n",

      "-fidgetboss_4000 Solution 5 (quick, conceptual) Define a win as a ball appearing in higher numbered box. Start from the first box. There are $4$ possible results in the box: Red, Green, Red and Green, or none, with an equal probability of $\\frac{1}{4}$ for each. If none of the balls is in the first box, the game restarts at the second box with the same kind of probability distribution, so if $p$ is the probability that Red wins, we can write $p = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4}p$ : there is a $\\frac{1}{4}$ probability that \"Red\" wins immediately, a $0$ probability in the cases \"Green\" or \"Red and Green\", and in the \"None\" case (which occurs with $\\frac{1}{4}$ probability), we then start again, giving the same probability $p$ .

To find the probablilty that red goes in a higher-numbered bin than green, we can simply remove all odd-index terms (i.e term $1$ , term $3$ , etc.), and then sum the remaining terms - this is in fact precisely equivalent to the method of Solution 2. Writing this out as another infinite geometric sequence, we are left with $\\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{1}{16}, \\frac{1}{64}, \\cdots$ . Summing, we get \\[\\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{4^i} = \\boxed{\\textbf{(C) } \\frac{1}{3}}\\]  Solution 7 Fixing the green ball to fall into bin $1$ gives a probability of $\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{2^2}+\\frac{1}{2^3} +...\\right)$ for the red ball to fall into a higher bin. Fixing the green ball to fall into bin $2$ gives a probability of $\\frac{1}{2^2}\\left(\\frac{1}{2^3}+\\frac{1}{2^4} +...\\right)$ .

We do not consider the case where the red ball goes into bin $1$ because the green ball has no where to go then. The chance that the green one is below the red one if the red one goes to bin $2$ is $\\frac{1}{4}$ chance that the red ball even goes in bin $2$ and $\\frac{1}{2}$ chance that the green ball goes into any bin less than $2$ . Similarly, if the red goes into bin $3$ , there is a $\\frac{1}{8} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{2}\\right)$ chance, or $\\frac{3}{32}$ , continuing like this, we get this sequence: $\\frac{1}{8}, \\frac{3}{32}, \\frac{7}{128}, ...$  Let $S$ equal the sum of our series: $S = \\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{3}{32} + \\frac{7}{128} + ...$ . That means we can write another equation: $\\frac{S}{4} = \\frac{1}{32} + \\frac{3}{128} + ...$  Subtracting $\\frac{S}{4}$ from $S$ , yields: $S - \\frac{S}{4} = \\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{2}{32} + \\frac{4}{128} + ...$  We see that the above series is a infinite geometric sequence with common ratio $\\frac{1}{2}$ . Therefore, the sum of that infinite series is $\\frac{\\frac{1}{8}}{\\frac{1}{2}}$ , which equals $\\frac{1}{4}$ . Our equation is now $S - \\frac{S}{4} = \\frac{1}{4}$ . Solving for $S$ shows that $S = \\frac{1}{3}$ . Our answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }\\frac{1}{3}}$  ~ericshi1685 Solution 9 (quick, symmetry) Denote $G,R$ the bin numbers of the green and red balls, respectively. The common probability distribution of $G,B$ can be constructed by keep splitting the remaining unassigned probability into two halves: one goes to the smallest number that has not been assigned, and the other goes to the rest. In other words, $\\Pr(G=k) = \\Pr (G>k), \\forall k \\in \\mathbb{N}$ . Then, \\[\\Pr(G>R)=\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\Pr(G>k) \\Pr(R=k) = \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\Pr(G=k) \\Pr(R=k) = \\Pr (G=R)\\]  Similarly $\\Pr(G<R)=\\Pr(G=R)$ . Therefore all three probabilities equal $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }\\frac{1}{3}}$ . ~asops Solution 10 The probability of the red ball falling ahead of the green ball is the same as the probability of the green ball falling ahead of the red ball. Therefore, if we calculate the probability of the red ball and the green ball falling inside the same box, we get the answer by subtracting that probability from 1. $P(same) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{8}\\right)^2 + \\cdots = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{16} + \\frac{1}{64} = \\frac{1}{3}$ . Therefore, our answer is $\\frac{1-\\frac{1}{3}}{2} = \\boxed{\\frac{1}{3}}$  -NL008 Solution 11 (This method might be a coincidence) My method could be completely coincidental, but, there are 3 different cases we have to consider: Red in a higher numbered bin than Green, Red in the same numbered bin as Green, or Green in a higher bin than Red. Since only the first case satisfies these conditions, the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }\\frac{1}{3}}.$  - ethancui0529 This is a coincidence, as the infinite geometric sum of the series that starts with $\\dfrac{1}{2}$ and has a common ratio of $\\dfrac{1}{2}$ is $\\dfrac{1}{3}$ . With any other starting term or ratio, this answer would not be valid. ~russellk Solution 12 (a little bit like Archimedes's Cheese Argument) Let's draw a square (if you want to, draw it larger) and divide it into four parts: Red on the top left corner, Green on the bottom right corner, Red and Green on the bottom left corner, and none on the top right. We then divide the \"none\" part also the same as we divided the original large square. Thus, the \"none\" probability decreases, and gradually it is divided into three parts: Red, Green, or Red and Green. We can visually see that the probability will be one third.

Notice that this is similar to choosing a divisor of $100,000^2 = 2^{10}5^{10}$ , which has $(10+1)(10+1) = 121$ divisors. However, some of the divisors of $2^{10}5^{10}$ cannot be written as a product of two distinct divisors of $2^5 \\cdot 5^5$ , namely: $1 = 2^05^0$ , $2^{10}5^{10}$ , $2^{10}$ , and $5^{10}$ . The last two cannot be written because the maximum factor of $100,000$ containing only $2$ s or $5$ s (and not both) is only $2^5$ or $5^5$ .

      " Divide the circle into four parts: the top semicircle by connecting E, F, and G( $A$ ); the bottom sector ( $B$ ), whose arc angle is $120^{\\circ}$ because the large circle's radius is $2$ and the short length (the radius of the smaller semicircles) is $1$ , giving a $30^{\\circ}-60^{\\circ}-90^{\\circ}$ triangle; the triangle formed by the radii of $A$ and the chord ( $C$ ); and the four parts which are the corners of a circle inscribed in a square ( $D$ ). Then the area is $A + B - C + D$ (in $B-C$ , we find the area of the bottom shaded region, and in $D$ we find the area of the shaded region above the semicircles but below the diameter). The area of $A$ is $\\frac{1}{2} \\pi \\cdot 2^2 = 2\\pi$ . The area of $B$ is $\\frac{120^{\\circ}}{360^{\\circ}} \\pi \\cdot 2^2 = \\frac{4\\pi}{3}$ .

Note from ~milquetoast: I found this solution incredibly unspecific and difficult to understand, especially in defining C,  because of the wording. I think what this solution is trying to say is the same as the first video solution down below. First we have to solve the area of the non-shaded area(the semicircles) that are in Circle $F$ .The middle semicircle has area $\\frac12\\pi$ and the other two have about half of their are inside the circle = $\\frac14\\pi\\ + \\frac14\\pi\\ + \\frac12\\pi\\ = \\pi$ . Then we subtract the part of the quartercircle that isn't in Circle $F$ . This is an area equal to that of a triangle minus an minor segment. The height of the triangle is the radius of the semicircles, which is $1$ . The length is the radius of Circle $F$ minus the length from the center of the middle semicircle up to until it is on the edge of the circle. Using the Pythagorean Theorem we can figure out that the length is: \\[\\sqrt{2^2 - 1^2} = \\sqrt{3}.\\] This means that the length of the triangle is $2 - \\sqrt{3}$ and so the area of the triangle is $\\frac{2 - \\sqrt{3}}{2}$ . For the area of the segment, it's the area of the sector minus the area of the triangle. The triangle's length is the radius of $F$ : $2$ , while its height is the radius of the semicircles: $1$ , so the area is 1. The  angle is $30^{\\circ}$ as the hypotenuse is the radius of $F$ and the opposite side is the radius of the semicircles, which means the area is $\\frac{1}{12}$ of the whole area, which is $4\\pi$ so the area of the sector is $\\frac{\\pi}{3}$ and the area of the segment is $\\frac{\\pi}{3} - 1$ and so the area of the part of the quartercircles that stick out of Circle $F$ is: \\[(\\frac{2 - \\sqrt{3}}{2})-(\\frac{\\pi}{3} - 1) = \\frac{2 - \\sqrt{3}}{2} + 1 - \\frac{\\pi}{3} = \\frac{4 - \\sqrt{3}}{2} - \\frac{\\pi}{3}.\\]  Since there are two, one for each side, we have to multiply it by 2, so we have ${4 - \\sqrt{3}} - \\frac{2\\pi}{3}$ , which we subtract from $\\pi$ which gets us $\\frac{5\\pi}{3} - 4 + \\sqrt{3}$ which we subtract from $4\\pi$  $=$  $\\frac{12\\pi}{3}$ , which is $\\frac{7\\pi}{3} + 4 - \\sqrt{3}$ so we get $7+3+4+3=\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) } 17}$ . https://youtu.be/nhDYNevwH1g  ~Education, the Study of Everything https://youtu.be/t3EWtMnJu2Y?t=516  ~ pi_is_3.14\n",

      " Firstly, notice that if Fiona jumps over the predator on pad $3$ , she must land on pad $4$ . Similarly, she must land on $7$ if she makes it past $6$ . Thus, we can split the problem into $3$ smaller sub-problems, separately finding the probability. Fiona skips $3$ , the probability she skips $6$ (starting at $4$ ) and the probability she doesn't skip $10$ (starting at $7$ ). Notice that by symmetry, the last of these three sub-problems is the complement of the first sub-problem, so the probability will be $1 - \\text{the probability obtained in the first sub-problem}$ . In the analysis below, we call the larger jump a $2$ -jump, and the smaller a $1$ -jump. For the first sub-problem, consider Fiona's options. She can either go $1$ -jump, $1$ -jump, $2$ -jump, with probability $\\frac{1}{8}$ , or she can go $2$ -jump, $2$ -jump, with probability $\\frac{1}{4}$ . These are the only two options, so they together make the answer $\\frac{1}{8}+\\frac{1}{4}=\\frac{3}{8}$ . We now also know the answer to the last sub-problem is $1-\\frac{3}{8}=\\frac{5}{8}$ . For the second sub-problem, Fiona must go $1$ -jump, $2$ -jump, with probability $\\frac{1}{4}$ , since any other option would result in her death to a predator. Thus, since the three sub-problems are independent, the final answer is $\\frac{3}{8} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot \\frac{5}{8} = \\boxed{\\textbf{(A) }\\frac{15}{256}}$ . Observe that since Fiona can only jump at most $2$ places per move, and still wishes to avoid pads $3$ and $6$ , she must also land on numbers $2$ , $4$ , $5$ , and $7$ . There are two ways to reach lily pad $2$ , namely $1$ -jump, $1$ -jump, with probability $\\frac{1}{4}$ , or just a $2$ -jump, with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$ . The total is thus $\\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{3}{4}$ . Fiona must now make a $2$ -jump to lily pad $4$ , again with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$ , giving $\\frac{3}{4} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{3}{8}$ . Similarly, Fiona must now make a $1$ -jump to reach lily pad $5$ , again with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$ , giving $\\frac{3}{8} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{3}{16}$ . Then she must make a $2$ -jump to reach lily pad $7$ , with probability $\\frac{1}{2}$ , yielding $\\frac{3}{16} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{3}{32}$ . Finally, to reach lily pad $10$ , Fiona has a few options - she can make $3$ consecutive $1$ -jumps, with probability $\\frac{1}{8}$ , or $1$ -jump, $2$ -jump, with probability $\\frac{1}{4}$ , or $2$ -jump, $1$ -jump, again with probability $\\frac{1}{4}$ . The final answer is thus $\\frac{3}{32} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4}\\right) = \\frac{3}{32} \\cdot \\frac{5}{8} = \\boxed{\\textbf{(A) } \\frac{15}{256}}$ . Let $p_n$ be the probability of landing on lily pad $n$ . Observe that if there are no restrictions, we would have \\[p_n = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot p_{n-1} + \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot p_{n-2}\\]  This is because, given that Fiona is at lily pad $n-2$ , there is a $\\frac{1}{2}$ probability that she will make a $2$ -jump to reach lily pad $n$ , and the same applies for a $1$ -jump to reach lily pad $n-1$ . We will now compute the values of $p_n$ recursively, but we will skip over $3$ and $6$ . That is, we will not consider any jumps from lily pads $3$ or $6$ when considering the probabilities. We obtain the following chart, where an X represents an unused/uncomputed value: [asy]  unitsize(40); string[] vals = {\"1\", \"$1/2$\", \"$3/4$\", \"X\", \"$3/8$\", \"$3/16$\", \"X\", \"$3/32$\", \"$3/64$\", \"$9/128$\", \"$15/256$\", \"X\"}; for(int i =0; i<= 11; ++i) { draw((i,0)--(i+1,0)--(i+1,1)--(i,1)--cycle); label((string) i, (i+0.5,0), S); label(vals[i], (i+0.5, 0.5)); } [/asy]  Hence the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A) } \\frac{15}{256}}$ . Note: If we let $p_n$ be the probability of surviving if the frog is on lily pad $n$ , using $p_{10}$ = 1, we can solve backwards and obtain the following chart: [asy]  unitsize(40); string[] vals = {\"$15/256$\", \"$5/128$\", \"$5/64$\", \"X\", \"$5/32$\", \"$5/16$\", \"X\", \"$5/8$\", \"$3/4$\", \"$1/2$\", \"1\", \"X\"}; for(int i =0; i<= 11; ++i) { draw((i,0)--(i+1,0)--(i+1,1)--(i,1)--cycle); label((string) (11-i), (i+0.5,0), S); label(vals[(11-i)], (i+0.5, 0.5)); } [/asy]  This is equivalent to finding the probability for each of the valid ways of tiling a $1$ -by- $11$ rectangular grid (with one end being lilypad $0$ and the other being lilypad $11$ ) with tiles of size $1 \\cdot 1$ and $1 \\cdot 2$ that satisfies the conditions mentioned in the problem. Obviously, for Fiona to skip pads $3$ and $6$ , a $1 \\cdot 2$ tile must be placed with one end at lilypad $2$ and the other at lilypad $4$ , and another $1 \\cdot 2$ must be placed with one end at lilypad $5$ and the other at lilypad $7$ . Thus, since only a $1 \\cdot 1$ tile can fit between the two aforementioned $1 \\cdot 2$ tiles, we will place it there. Now, we can solve this problem with simple casework. Case 1: Two $1 \\cdot 1$ tiles fill the space between lilypads $0$ and $2$ . There are two ways to permute a placement of a $1 \\cdot 1$ tile and a $1 \\cdot 2$ tile between lilypads $7$ and $10$ , so our probability for this sub-case is $\\frac{2}{2^7} = \\frac{1}{64}$ . In the other subcase where the space between lilypads $7$ and $10$ is completely filled with $1 \\cdot 1$ tiles, there is trivially only one tiling, thus the probability for this sub-case is $\\frac{1}{2^8} = \\frac{1}{256}.$ The total probability for this case is $\\frac{1}{64} + \\frac{1}{256} = \\frac{5}{256}.$  Case 2: A single $1 \\cdot 2$ tile fills the space between lilypads $0$ and $2$ . Note that the combined probability for this case will be double that of Case $1$ , since a single $1 \\cdot 2$ tile takes up one less tile than two $1 \\cdot 1$ tiles. Thus, the probability for this case is $2 \\cdot \\frac{5}{256} = \\frac{10}{256}.$  Summing our cases up, we obtain $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A) } \\frac{15}{256}}$ . -fidgetboss_4000 Note that there is exactly one way to reach lily pad $10$ in $8$ moves, and there is a probability of $\\frac{1}{256}$ that this occurs. All other paths take less than $8$ moves, and thus the probability of them occurring is $\\frac{n}{2^k}$ for $k < 8$ . Thus, the answer must have a denominator of $256$ , or answer choice $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A)}}$ .\n",

      " Convert $z$ and $z^3$ into modulus-argument (polar) form, giving $z=r\\text{cis}(\\theta)$ for some $r$ and $\\theta$ . Thus, by De Moivre's Theorem, $z^3=r^3\\text{cis}(3\\theta)$ . Since the distance from $0$ to $z$ is $r$ , and the triangle is equilateral, the distance from $0$ to $z^3$ must also be $r$ , so $r^3=r$ , giving $r=1$ . (We know $r \\neq 0$ since the problem statement specifies that $z$ must be nonzero.) Now, to get from $z$ to $z^3$ , which should be a rotation of $60^{\\circ}$ if the triangle is equilateral, we multiply by $z^2 = r^2\\text{cis}(2\\theta)$ , again using De Moivre's Theorem. Thus we require $2\\theta=\\pm\\frac{\\pi}{3} + 2\\pi k$ (where $k$ can be any integer). If $0 < \\theta < \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ , we must have $\\theta=\\frac{\\pi}{6}$ , while if $\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\leq \\theta < \\pi$ , we must have $\\theta = \\frac{5\\pi}{6}$ . Hence there are $2$ values that work for $0 < \\theta < \\pi$ . By symmetry, the interval $\\pi \\leq \\theta < 2\\pi$ will also give $2$ solutions. The answer is thus $2 + 2 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(D) }4}$ . Note : Here's a graph showing how $z$ and $z^3$ move as $\\theta$ increases: https://www.desmos.com/calculator/xtnpzoqkgs . As before, $r=1$ . Represent $z$ in polar form. By De Moivre's Theorem, $z^3=\\text{cis}(3\\theta)$ . To form an equilateral triangle, their difference in angle must be $\\frac{\\pi}{3}$ , so \\[\\frac{\\text{cis}(3\\theta)}{\\text{cis}(\\theta)}=\\text{cis}(2\\theta)=\\text{cis}(\\pm\\frac{\\pi}{3})\\] From the polar form of $z$ , we know that $0\\geq\\theta\\leq2\\pi$ , so $\\text{cis}(2\\theta)$ cycles in a circle twice. By contrast, $\\pm\\frac{\\pi}{3}$ represent $2$ fixed, distinct points. Thus, $\\text{cis}(2\\theta)$ intersects these points twice each $\\implies\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) }4}$  Visual: https://www.desmos.com/calculator/rnpxzns0jn   To be more rigorous, you can find the $4$ solutions. $\\text{cis}(2\\theta)$ cycles twice, so $2\\theta=\\pm\\frac{\\pi}{3}+2n\\pi$ , where $n=0,1$ . Then, $\\theta=\\frac{\\pi}{6}$ , $\\frac{7\\pi}{6}$ , $\\frac{5\\pi}{6}$ , $\\frac{11\\pi}{6}$ . Substitute those values into $z$ and check that they are valid. $\\implies\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) }4}$  (Solution by BJHHar) For the triangle to be equilateral, the vector from $z$ to $z^3$ , i.e $z^3 - z$ , must be a $60^{\\circ}$ rotation of the vector from $0$ to $z$ , i.e. just $z$ . Thus we must have \\[\\frac{(z^3-z)}{(z-0)}=\\text{cis}{(\\pi/3)} \\text{ or } \\text{cis}(5\\pi/3)\\]  Simplifying gives \\[z^2-1= \\text{cis}(\\pi/3) \\text{ or } z^2-1= \\text{cis}(5\\pi/3)\\] so \\[z^2=1+\\text{cis}(\\pi/3) \\text{ or } z^2=1+\\text{cis}(5\\pi/3)\\]  Since any nonzero complex number will have two square roots, each equation gives two solutions. Thus, as before, the total number of possible values of $z$ is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) }4}$ . Since the complex numbers $0,z,$ and $z^3$ form an equilateral triangle in the complex plane, we note that either $z^3$ is a 60 degrees counterclockwise rotation about the origin from $z$ or $z$ is a 60 degrees counterclockwise rotation about the origin from $z^3$ . Therefore, we note that either $z^3 = z \\text{cis} 60^\\circ{}$ or $z \\text{cis}(-60^\\circ{}) = z^3$  The first equation in $z$ (meaning $z^3 = z \\text{cis} 60^\\circ{}$ ) gives us: $z^2 = cis 60^\\circ{}$ , which gives 2 solutions in $z$ . The second equation in $z$ (which is $z \\text{cis} (-60^\\circ{}) = z^3$ ) gives us $z^2 = \\text{cis} (-60^\\circ{})$ , which must give another 2 solutions in $z$ . Therefore, there are $\\boxed{(D) 4}$ solutions for $z$ . (Professor-Mom) Note: The motivation for this method came from an older AIME problem, namely https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/1994_AIME_Problems/Problem_8 . Let the $z = re^{i\\theta}$ , so $z^3 = r^3e^{3i\\theta}$ . To have an equilateral triangle, we must have $|z^3| = |z|$ , so $r^3 = r$ , so $r= 1$ . Note that the angle between $z^3$ and $z$ is $3\\theta - \\theta = 2\\theta$ . Then, by the Law of Cosines, \\[|z^3 - z|^2 = |z|^2 + |z^3|^2 - 2|z||z^3|\\cos 2\\theta.\\]  Since we have an equilateral triangle, it must be that $|z^3 - z| =|z| = |z^3| = r = 1$ . Hence, \\[1 = 2 - 2\\cos 2\\theta = 2 - 2(1-2\\sin^2\\theta) = 4\\sin^2\\theta,\\]  \\[\\sin^2\\theta = \\frac{1}{4}\\]  \\[\\sin\\theta = \\pm\\frac{1}{2}\\]  \\[\\theta = \\pm\\frac{\\pi}{6}, \\pm\\frac{5\\pi}{6}.\\]  These $4$ values of $\\theta$ correspond to $\\boxed{(D)4}$ distinct values of $z$ .\n",

      " As in Solution 1, let $A=(0, 0, 0), B=(3, 0, 0), C=(3, 3, 0), D=(0, 3, 0),$ and $E=(0, 0, 6)$ , and calculate the coordinates of $P$ , $Q$ , and $R$ as $P=(2,0,2), Q=(0,2,2), R=(1,1,4)$ . Now notice that the plane determined by $\\triangle PQR$ is perpendicular to the plane determined by $ABCD$ . To see this, consider the bird's-eye view , looking down upon $P$ , $Q$ , and $R$ projected onto $ABCD$ : [asy] unitsize(40); for(int i =0; i<=3; ++i) { draw((0,i)--(3,i)); draw((i,0)--(i,3)); } label(\"$A$\", (0,0), SW); label(\"$B$\", (3,0), SE); label(\"$C$\", (3,3), NE); label(\"$D$\", (0,3), NW); label(\"$P$\", (2,0), S); label(\"$Q$\", (0,2), W); label(\"$R$\", (1,1), NE); dot((2,0)); dot((0,2)); dot((1,1)); draw((0,2)--(2,0)); [/asy] Additionally, we know that $PQ$ is parallel to the plane determined by $ABCD$ , since $P$ and $Q$ have the same $z$ -coordinate. Hence the height of $\\triangle PQR$ is equal to the $z$ -coordinate of $R$ minus the $z$ -coordinate of $P$ , giving $4-2= 2$ . By the distance formula, $\\overline{PQ} = 2\\sqrt{2}$ , so the area of $\\triangle PQR$ is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 2\\sqrt{2} \\cdot 2 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(C) } 2\\sqrt{2}}$ . By the Pythagorean Theorem, we can calculate $EB=ED=3\\sqrt{5},EC=3\\sqrt{6},ER= \\sqrt{6},$ and $EP=EQ=2 \\sqrt{5}$ . Now by the Law of Cosines in $\\triangle BEC$ , we have $\\cos{\\left(\\angle BEC\\right)}=\\frac{EB^2+EC^2-BC^2}{2 \\cdot EB \\cdot EC}=\\frac{5}{\\sqrt{30}}$ . Similarly, by the Law of Cosines in $\\triangle EPR$ , we have $PR^2=ER^2+EP^2-2 \\cdot ER \\cdot EP \\cdot \\cos{\\left(\\angle BEC\\right)}=6$ , so $PR=\\sqrt{6}$ . Observe that $\\triangle ERP \\cong \\triangle ERQ$ (by side-angle-side ), so $QR=PR=\\sqrt{6}$ . Next, notice that $PQ$ is parallel to $DB$ , and therefore $\\triangle EQP$ is similiar to $\\triangle EDB$ . Thus we have $\\frac{QP}{DB}=\\frac{EP}{EB}=\\frac{2}{3}$ . Since $DB=3\\sqrt{2}$ , this gives $PQ=2 \\sqrt{2}$ . Now we have the three side lengths of isosceles $\\triangle PQR$ : $PR=QR=\\sqrt{6}$ , $PQ=2 \\sqrt{2}$ . Letting the midpoint of $PQ$ be $S$ , $RS$ is the perpendicular bisector of $PQ$ , and so can be used as a height of $\\triangle PQR$ (taking $PQ$ as the base). Using the Pythagorean Theorem again, we have $RS=\\sqrt{PR^2-PS^2}=2$ , so the area of $\\triangle PQR$ is $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot PQ \\cdot RS = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 2\\sqrt{2} \\cdot 2 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(C) } 2 \\sqrt{2}}$ .\n",

      " On the first turn, each player starts off with $$1$ . Each turn after that, there are only two possibilities: either everyone stays at $$1$ , which we will write as $(1-1-1)$ , or the distribution of money becomes $$2-$1-$0$ in some order, which we write as $(2-1-0)$ . ( $(3-0-0)$ cannot be achieved since either(1)the person cannot give money to himself or (2)there are a maximum of 2 dollars being distributed and the person has nothing to start with). We will consider these two states separately. In the $(1-1-1)$ state, each person has two choices for whom to give their dollar to, meaning there are $2^3=8$ possible ways that the money can be rearranged. Note that there are only two ways that we can reach $(1-1-1)$ again: 1. Raashan gives his money to Sylvia, who gives her money to Ted, who gives his money to Raashan. 2. Raashan gives his money to Ted, who gives his money to Sylvia, who gives her money to Raashan. Thus, the probability of staying in the $(1-1-1)$ state is $\\frac{1}{4}$ , while the probability of going to the $(2-1-0)$ state is $\\frac{3}{4}$ (we can check that the 6 other possibilities lead to $(2-1-0)$ ) In the $(2-1-0)$ state, we will label the person with $$2$ as person A, the person with $$1$ as person B, and the person with $$0$ as person C. Person A has two options for whom to give money to, and person B has 2 options for whom to give money to, meaning there are total $2\\cdot 2 = 4$ ways the money can be redistributed. The only way that the distribution can return to $(1-1-1)$ is if A gives $$1$ to B, and B gives $$1$ to C. We check the other possibilities to find that they all lead back to $(2-1-0)$ . Thus, the probability of going to the $(1-1-1)$ state is $\\frac{1}{4}$ , while the probability of staying in the $(2-1-0)$ state is $\\frac{3}{4}$ . No matter which state we are in, the probability of going to the $(1-1-1)$ state is always $\\frac{1}{4}$ . This means that, after the bell rings 2018 times, regardless of what state the money distribution is in, there is a $\\frac{1}{4}$ probability of going to the $(1-1-1)$ state after the 2019th bell ring. Thus, our answer is simply $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) } \\frac{1}{4}}$ . After the first ring, either nothing changes, or someone has $$2$ . No one can have $$3$ , since in that hypothetical round, that person would have to give away $$1$ . Thus, the outcome is either $1-1-1$ or six symmetrical cases where one person gets $$2$ (e.g. a $1-2-0$ or $2-1-0$ split).  Case 1: Probability of returning to 1-1-1 from 1-1-1  There are two ways for the three people to exchange dollars to get to the same $1-1-1$ result. To see this, seat R, S, and T in a circle. Each person gives their dollar to either the person at left, or at right, to result in again 1 dollar for each person. There are 8 overall possibilities (since each person has 2 choices when giving away his or her dollar, therefore $2^3$ total possibilities). So, there is $1/4$ chance of returning to $1-1-1$ .  Case 2: Probability of returning to 1-1-1 from 2-1-0  Without loss of generality, take the $2-1-0$ case. Only 2 people can give money, so there are now $2^2=4$ possible outcomes after the bell rings. It either decomposes back into $1-1-1$ , $2-1-0$ (remained unchanged), $2-0-1$ , $1-0-2$ . Thus, there is a $1/4$ chance of returning to $1-1-1$ . Notice that this works for any of the 6 cases, as each is symmetrical to the others.  Answer  Since the starting state has a $1/4$ chance of remaining unchanged, and each of the different 6 symmetric states all also have a $1/4$ chance of reverting back to $1-1-1$ , the chance of it being $1-1-1$ after any state is always $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) } \\frac{1}{4}}$ . The two possible scenarios are they all have $1$ dollar, or one person has $2$ dollars, another has $1$ , and the last has none. We will consider the second scenario all to be the same no matter who has the $2$ dollars, $1$ dollar or $0$ dollars from symmetry. Let's consider all possible scenarios when the bell rings if they currently all have 1 dollar. \\[SRR -> 2, 1, 0\\]  \\[SRS -> 2, 1, 0\\]  \\[STR -> 1, 1, 1\\]  \\[STS -> 2, 1, 0\\]  \\[TRR -> 2, 1, 0\\]  \\[TRS -> 1, 1, 1\\]  \\[TTR -> 2, 1, 0\\]  \\[TTS -> 2, 1, 0\\] We see that $\\frac{2}{8}$ or $\\frac{1}{4}$ of the cases lead to them continuing to all of them having $1$ dollar.\t\n",
      "Now, let's consider all the possible scenarios when the bell rings if they currently have $2, 1, 0$ dollars. Without loss of generality, let's say that R and S have $2$ and $1$ dollar respectively. (We can switch the names, our answer won't change). \\[SR -> 2, 1, 0\\]  \\[ST -> 1, 1, 1\\]  \\[TR -> 2, 1, 0\\]  \\[TT -> 2, 1, 0\\] We see that $\\frac{1}{4}$ of the cases lead to them changing to all have $1$ dollar. So, no matter what was the scenario when the bell had been rung $2018$ times, when the bell is rung the $2019$ th time, there is always a $\\frac{1}{4}$ chance that it will turn into (or stay as) $(1, 1, 1)$  Let the state $(1-1-1)$ be $A$ , and state $(2-1-0)$ without considering the order be $B$ . Similar to the previous $3$ solutions, after a bell ring, the probability of state $A$ staying in state $A$ is $\\frac{1}{4}$ , that of state $A$ transiting to state $B$ is $\\frac{3}{4}$ , that of state $B$ staying in state $B$ is $\\frac{3}{4}$ , that of state $B$ transiting to state $A$ is $\\frac{1}{4}$ . Using a Markov Chain , the state transition diagram is shown below. MarkovChain.png \\begin{align} P_A &= P_A \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} + P_B \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} \\\\ P_B &= P_A \\cdot \\frac{3}{4} + P_B \\cdot \\frac{3}{4} \\\\ &P_A + P_B = 1 \\end{align}  $(1)$ and $(2)$ are equivalent, from $(1)$ or $(2)$ , we get $P_B = 3P_A$ . Solving the system of equations, we get $P_A = \\boxed{\\textbf{(B) } \\frac{1}{4}}$  Note: the number of bell rings doesn't matter, $2019$ is redundant. ~ isabelchen  This works if one is short on time. Looking at how simple answer choices are, it seems like the number of bell rings is extra information (the other solutions show that this is true). So, we assume that the probability will be the same no matter how many times the bell rings, and we calculate it for $1$ bell ring. Each person can give their dollar to $2$ other people, so there are $2^3=8$ ways to switch up the money. Out of these $8$ ways, $2! = 2$ of them leave everyone with a dollar again, so our probability is $\\tfrac{2}{8} = \\boxed{\\textbf{(B) } \\frac{1}{4}}$ . https://youtu.be/rLAcJe3o-uA?t=1086  ~ pi_is_3.14 https://youtu.be/XT440PjAFmQ \n",

      " First, observe that the two tangent lines are of identical length. Therefore, supposing that the point of intersection is $(x, 0)$ , the Pythagorean Theorem gives $\\sqrt{(x-6)^2 + 13^2} = \\sqrt{(x-12)^2 + 11^2}$ . This simplifies to $x = 5$ . Further, notice (due to the right angles formed by a radius and its tangent line) that the quadrilateral (a kite) $AOBX$ is cyclic. Therefore, we can apply Ptolemy's Theorem to give: $2\\sqrt{170}r = d \\sqrt{40}$ , where $r$ is the radius of the circle and $d$ is the distance between the circle's center and $(5, 0)$ . Therefore, $d = \\sqrt{17}r$ . Using the Pythagorean Theorem on the right triangle $OAX$ (or $OBX$ ), we find that $170 + r^2 = 17r^2$ , so $r^2 = \\frac{85}{8}$ , and thus the area of the circle is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }\\frac{85}{8}\\pi}$ . Diagram for Solution 1 caption  ~BakedPotato66 We firstly obtain $x=5$ as in Solution 1. Label the point $(5,0)$ as $C$ . The midpoint $M$ of segment $AB$ is $(9, 12)$ . Notice that the center of the circle must lie on the line passing through the points $C$ and $M$ . Thus, the center of the circle lies on the line $y=3x-15$ . Line $AC$ is $y=13x-65$ . Therefore, the slope of the line perpendicular to $AC$ is $-\\frac{1}{13}$ , so its equation is $y=-\\frac{x}{13}+\\frac{175}{13}$ . But notice that this line must pass through $A(6, 13)$ and $(x, 3x-15)$ . Hence $3x-15=-\\frac{x}{13}+\\frac{175}{13} \\Rightarrow x=\\frac{37}{4}$ . So the center of the circle is $\\left(\\frac{37}{4}, \\frac{51}{4}\\right)$ . Finally, the distance between the center, $\\left(\\frac{37}{4}, \\frac{51}{4}\\right)$ , and point $A$ is $\\frac{\\sqrt{170}}{4}$ . Thus the area of the circle is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }\\frac{85}{8}\\pi}$ . The midpoint of $AB$ is $D(9,12)$ . Let the tangent lines at $A$ and $B$ intersect at $C(a,0)$ on the $x$ -axis. Then $CD$ is the perpendicular bisector of $AB$ . Let the center of the circle be $O$ . Then $\\triangle AOC$ is similar to $\\triangle DAC$ , so $\\frac{OA}{AC} = \\frac{AD}{DC}$ .\n",
      "The slope of $AB$ is $\\frac{13-11}{6-12}=\\frac{-1}{3}$ , so the slope of $CD$ is $3$ . Hence, the equation of $CD$ is $y-12=3(x-9) \\Rightarrow y=3x-15$ . Letting $y=0$ , we have $x=5$ , so $C = (5,0)$ .

      " Firstly, if $r=s$ , then $a=b=c$ , so the equation becomes $ax^2 + ax + a = 0 \\Rightarrow x^2 + x + 1=0$ , which has no real roots. Hence there are three cases we need to consider: Case 1 : $a=b=r$ and $c=s \\neq r$ :\n",
      "The equation becomes $ax^2+ax+c=0$ , and by Vieta's Formulas, we have $a+c=-1$ and $ac = \\frac{c}{a}$ . This second equation becomes $(a^2-1)c=0$ . Hence one possibility is $c=0$ , in which case $a=-1$ , giving the equation $-x^2 - x = 0$ , which has roots $0$ and ${-}1$ . This gives one valid solution. On the other hand, if $c\\neq 0$ , then $a^2-1=0$ , so $a = \\pm 1$ . If $a=1$ , we have $c=-2$ , and the equation is $x^2 + x - 2 = 0$ , which clearly works, giving a second valid solution. If $a=-1$ , then we have $c=0$ , which has already been considered, so this possibility gives no further valid solutions. Case 2 : $a=c=r$ , $b=s \\neq r$ :\n",
      "The equation becomes $ax^2 + bx + a = 0$ , so by Vieta's Formulas, we have $a+b = -\\frac{b}{a}$ and $ab = 1$ . These equations reduce to $a^3 + a + 1 = 0$ . By sketching a graph of this function, we see that there is exactly one real root. (Alternatively, note that as it is of odd degree, there is at least one real root, and by differentiation, it has no stationary points, so there is at most one real root. Combining these gives exactly one real root.) This gives a third valid solution. Case 3 : $a=r$ , $b=c=s \\neq r$ : \n",

      "Observe that $b \\neq 0$ , as if it were $0$ , the equation would just have one real root, $0$ , so this would not give a valid solution. Thus, taking the second equation and dividing both sides by $b$ , we deduce have $a=\\frac{1}{a}$ , so $a=\\pm 1$ . If $a=1$ , we have $1+b=-b$ , giving $b=-\\frac{1}{2}$ , so the equation is $x^2 - \\frac{1}{2}x - \\frac{1}{2} = 0$ , which is a fourth valid solution. If $a=-1$ , we have $1+b=b$ , which is a contradiction, so this case gives no further valid solutions. Hence the total number of valid solutions is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) } 4}$ .\n",

      " We first prove that $x_n > 4$ for all $n \\ge 0$ , by induction. Observe that \\[x_{n+1} - 4 = \\frac{x_n^2 + 5x_n + 4 - 4(x_n+6)}{x_n+6} = \\frac{(x_n - 4)(x_n+5)}{x_n+6}.\\] so (since $x_n$ is clearly positive for all $n$ , from the initial definition), $x_{n+1} > 4$ if and only if $x_{n} > 4$ . We similarly prove that $x_n$ is decreasing: \\[x_{n+1} - x_n = \\frac{x_n^2 + 5x_n + 4 - x_n(x_n+6)}{x_n+6} = \\frac{4-x_n}{x_n+6} < 0.\\]  Now we need to estimate the value of $x_{n+1}-4$ , which we can do using the rearranged equation: \\[x_{n+1} - 4 = (x_n-4)\\cdot\\frac{x_n + 5}{x_n+6}.\\] Since $x_n$ is decreasing, $\\frac{x_n + 5}{x_n+6}$ is also decreasing, so we have \\[\\frac{9}{10} < \\frac{x_n + 5}{x_n+6} \\le \\frac{10}{11}\\] and \\[\\frac{9}{10}(x_n-4) < x_{n+1} - 4 \\le \\frac{10}{11}(x_n-4).\\]  This becomes \\[\\left(\\frac{9}{10}\\right)^n = \\left(\\frac{9}{10}\\right)^n \\left(x_0-4\\right) < x_{n} - 4 \\le \\left(\\frac{10}{11}\\right)^n \\left(x_0-4\\right) = \\left(\\frac{10}{11}\\right)^n.\\] The problem thus reduces to finding the least value of $n$ such that \\[\\left(\\frac{9}{10}\\right)^n < x_{n} - 4 \\le \\frac{1}{2^{20}} \\text{  and  }  \\left(\\frac{10}{11}\\right)^{n-1} > x_{n-1} - 4 > \\frac{1}{2^{20}}.\\]  Taking logarithms, we get $n \\ln \\frac{9}{10} < -20 \\ln 2$ and $(n-1)\\ln \\frac{10}{11} > -20 \\ln 2$ , i.e. \\[n > \\frac{20\\ln 2}{\\ln\\frac{10}{9}} \\text{  and  }  n-1 < \\frac{20\\ln 2}{\\ln\\frac{11}{10}} .\\]  As approximations, we can use $\\ln\\frac{10}{9} \\approx \\frac{1}{9}$ , $\\ln\\frac{11}{10} \\approx \\frac{1}{10}$ , and $\\ln 2\\approx 0.7$ . These approximations allow us to estimate \\[126 < n < 141,\\] which gives $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) } [81,242]}$ . The condition where $x_m\\leq 4+\\frac{1}{2^{20}}$ gives the motivation to make a substitution to change the equilibrium from $4$ to $0$ . We can substitute $x_n = y_n + 4$ to achieve that. Now, we need to find the smallest value of $m$ such that $y_m\\leq \\frac{1}{2^{20}}$ given that $y_0 = 1$ .  Factoring the recursion $x_{n+1} = \\frac{x_n^2 + 5x_n+4}{x_n + 6}$ , we get: $x_{n+1}=\\dfrac{(x_n + 4)(x_n + 1)}{x_n + 6} \\Rightarrow y_{n+1}+4=\\dfrac{(y_n+8)(y_n+5)}{y_n+10}$  $y_{n+1}+4=\\dfrac{y_n^2+13y_n+40}{y_n+10} = \\dfrac{y_n^2+9y_n +(4y_n+40)}{y_n+10}$  $y_{n+1}+4=\\dfrac{y_n^2+9y_n}{y_n+10} + 4$  $y_{n+1}=\\dfrac{y_n^2+9y_n}{y_n+10}$ .  Using wishful thinking, we can simplify the recursion as follows: $y_{n+1} = \\frac{y_n^2 + 9y_n + y_n - y_n}{y_n + 10}$  $y_{n+1} = \\frac{y_n(y_n + 10) - y_n}{y_n + 10}$  $y_{n+1} = y_n - \\frac{y_n}{y_n + 10}$  $y_{n+1} = y_n\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{y_n + 10}\\right)$ . The recursion looks like a geometric sequence with the ratio changing slightly after each term. Notice from the recursion that the $y_n$ sequence is strictly decreasing, so all the terms after $y_0$ will be less than 1. Also, notice that all the terms in sequence will be positive. Both of these can be proven by induction. With both of those observations in mind, $\\frac{9}{10} < 1 - \\frac{1}{y_n + 10} \\leq \\frac{10}{11}$ . Combining this with the fact that the recursion resembles a geometric sequence, we conclude that $\\left(\\frac{9}{10}\\right)^n < y_n \\leq \\left(\\frac{10}{11}\\right)^n.$  $\\frac{9}{10}$ is approximately equal to $\\frac{10}{11}$ and the ranges that the answer choices give us are generous, so we should use either $\\frac{9}{10}$ or $\\frac{10}{11}$ to find a rough estimate for $m$ . Since $\\dfrac{1}{2}=0.5$ , that means $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}=2^{-\\frac{1}{2}} \\approx 0.7$ . Additionally, $\\left(\\frac{9}{10}\\right)^3=0.729$  Therefore, we can estimate that $2^{-\\frac{1}{2}} < y_3$ . Raising both sides to the 40th power, we get $2^{-20} < (y_3)^{40}$  But $y_3 = (y_0)^3$ , so $2^{-20} < (y_0)^{120}$ and therefore, $2^{-20} < y_{120}$ . This tells us that $m$ is somewhere around 120, so our answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) } [81,242]}$ . Since the choices are rather wide ranges, we can use approximation to make it easier. Notice that \\[x_{n+1} - x_n = \\frac{4-x_n}{x_n+6}\\] And $x_0 =5$ , we know that $x_n$ is a declining sequence, and as it get close to 4 its decline will slow, never falling below 4. So we'll use 4 to approximate $x_n$ in the denominator so that we have a solvable difference equation: \\[x_{n+1} - x_n = \\frac{4-x_n}{10}\\]  \\[x_{n+1} = \\frac{9}{10}x_n + \\frac{2}{5}\\] Solve it with $x_0 = 5$ , we have \\[x_n = 4 + (\\frac{9}{10})^n\\] Now we wish to find $n$ so that \\[(\\frac{9}{10})^n \\approx \\frac{1}{2^{20}}\\]  \\[n \\approx \\frac{\\log{2^{20}}}{\\log{10}-\\log9} \\approx \\frac{20*0.3}{0.05} = 120\\] Since 120 is safely within the range of [81,242], we have the answer. $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) } [81,242]}$ . -Mathdummy We start by simplifying the recursion: $x_{n+1} = x_n + \\frac{4-x_n}{x_n+6}$ .\n",
      "While $x_n > 4$ , $x_n$ is a decreasing sequence. Let $x_n = 4 + f_n$ . Then \\[x_{n} - x_{n+1} = \\frac{x_n-4}{x_n+6} = \\frac{f_n}{10 + f_n} \\approx \\frac{f_n}{10}.\\] Now notice that we want to find $m$ , such that $x_m \\leq 4 + \\frac{1}{2^{20}}$ , and $x_0 = 4 + \\frac{1}{2^0}$ . \n",
      "We are going to find an approximate number of steps to go from $4 + \\frac{1}{2^i}$ to $4 + \\frac{1}{2^{i+1}}$ . \n",
      "If $x_j = 4 + \\frac{1}{2^i}$ , then $f_j = \\frac{1}{2^i}$ and if $x_k = 4 + \\frac{1}{2^{i+1}}$ , then $f_k = \\frac{1}{2^{i+1}}$ . Then \\[x_j - x_k = \\frac{1}{2^{i+1}} \\approx \\frac{f_j}{10} + \\frac{f_{j+1}}{10} + ... + \\frac{f_{k-1}}{10}.\\] Furthermore, \\[\\frac{1}{2^i} = f_j > f_{j+1} > f_{j+2} > ... > f_{k-1} > f_k = \\frac{1}{2^{i+1}}.\\] Therefore, \\[(k-j) \\cdot \\frac{\\frac{1}{2^i}}{10} > \\frac{f_j}{10} + \\frac{f_{j+1}}{10} + ... + \\frac{f_{k-1}}{10} > (k-j) \\cdot \\frac{\\frac{1}{2^{i+1}}}{10},\\] so $5 < k-j < 10$ . Therefore, to go from $f_0 = \\frac{1}{2^0}$ to $f_m = \\frac{1}{2^{20}}$ , we will need to do this 20 times, which means $100 < m - 0 < 200$ , which is within the range of [81,242], so we have the answer. $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) } [81,242]}$ . -alligator112 The actual value of $m$ is $m=133$ . https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toHqTtcCcJQ  ~MathProblemSolvingSkills.com Video Solution: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok7bYOdiF6M  \n",

      " Let $G_1$ , $G_2$ , $G_3$ be the centroids of $ABC$ , $BCD$ , and $CDA$ respectively, and let $M$ be the midpoint of $BC$ . $A$ , $G_1$ , and $M$ are collinear due to well-known properties of the centroid. Likewise, $D$ , $G_2$ , and $M$ are collinear as well. Because (as is also well-known) $3MG_1 = AM$ and $3MG_2 = DM$ , we have $\\triangle MG_1G_2\\sim\\triangle MAD$ . This implies that $AD$ is parallel to $G_1G_2$ , and in terms of lengths, $AD = 3G_1G_2$ . (SAS Similarity) We can apply the same argument to the pair of triangles $\\triangle BCD$ and $\\triangle ACD$ , concluding that $AB$ is parallel to $G_2G_3$ and $AB = 3G_2G_3$ . Because $3G_1G_2 = 3G_2G_3$ (due to the triangle being equilateral), $AB = AD$ , and the pair of parallel lines preserve the $60^{\\circ}$ angle, meaning $\\angle BAD = 60^\\circ$ . Therefore $\\triangle BAD$ is equilateral. At this point, we can finish as in Solution 1, or, to avoid using trigonometry, we can continue as follows: Let $BD = 2x$ , where $2 < x < 4$ due to the Triangle Inequality in $\\triangle BCD$ . By breaking the quadrilateral into $\\triangle ABD$ and $\\triangle BCD$ , we can create an expression for the area of $ABCD$ . We use the formula for the area of an equilateral triangle given its side length to find the area of $\\triangle ABD$ and Heron's formula to find the area of $\\triangle BCD$ . After simplifying, \\[[ABCD] = x^2\\sqrt 3 + \\sqrt{36 - (x^2-10)^2}\\]  Substituting $k = x^2 - 10$ , the expression becomes \\[[ABCD] = k\\sqrt{3} + \\sqrt{36 - k^2} + 10\\sqrt{3}\\]  We can ignore the $10\\sqrt{3}$ for now and focus on $k\\sqrt{3} + \\sqrt{36 - k^2}$ . By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, \\[\\left(k\\sqrt 3 + \\sqrt{36-k^2}\\right)^2 \\leq \\left(\\left(\\sqrt{3}\\right)^2+1^2\\right)\\left(\\left(k\\right)^2 + \\left(\\sqrt{36-k^2}\\right)^2\\right)\\]  The RHS simplifies to $12^2$ , meaning the maximum value of $k\\sqrt{3} + \\sqrt{36 - k^2}$ is $12$ . Thus the maximum possible area of $ABCD$ is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }12 + 10\\sqrt{3}}$ . Let $A$ , $B$ , $C$ , and $D$ correspond to the complex numbers $a$ , $b$ , $c$ , and $d$ , respectively. Then, the complex representations of the centroids are $(a+b+c)/3$ , $(b+c+d)/3$ , and $(a+c+d)/3$ . The pairwise distances between the centroids are $\\lvert (d-a)/3 \\rvert$ , $\\lvert (b-a)/3 \\rvert$ , and $\\lvert (b-d)/3 \\rvert$ , all equal. Thus, $\\lvert (b-a)/3 \\rvert=\\lvert (d-a)/3 \\rvert=\\lvert (b-d)/3 \\rvert$ , so $\\lvert (b-a) \\rvert=\\lvert (d-a) \\rvert=\\lvert (b-d) \\rvert$ . Hence, $\\triangle DBA$ is equilateral.

      " The volume of each cube follows the pattern of $n^3$ , for $n$ is between $1$ and $7$ . We see that the total surface area can be comprised of three parts: the sides of the cubes, the tops of the cubes, and the bottom of the $7\\times 7\\times 7$ cube (which is just $7 \\times 7 = 49$ ). The sides areas can be measured as the sum $4\\sum_{n=1}^{7} n^2$ , giving us $560$ . Structurally, if we examine the tower from the top, we see that it really just forms a $7\\times 7$ square of area $49$ . Therefore, we can say that the total surface area is $560 + 49 + 49 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }658}$ .\n",
      "Alternatively, for the area of the tops, we could have found the sum $\\sum_{n=2}^{7}((n)^{2}-(n-1)^{2})$ , giving us $49$ as well. ~ciceronii Note: The area on top and bottom are 49 because the largest area is 49, and the other cubes are \"inscribed\" in it.  It can quickly be seen that the side lengths of the cubes are the integers from 1 to 7 inclusive. First, we will calculate the total surface area of the cubes, ignoring overlap.

Then, we need to subtract out the overlapped parts of the cubes. Between each consecutive pair of cubes, one of the smaller cube's faces is completely covered, along with an equal area of one of the larger cube's faces. The total area of the overlapped parts of the cubes is thus equal to $2\\sum_{n=1}^{6} n^2 = 182$ .

Also, since the cubes are stacked, we have to find the difference between each $n^2$ and $(n-1)^2$ side length as $n$ ranges from $7$ to $2$ . We then come up with this: $5(49)+13+4(36)+11+4(25)+9+4(16)+7+4(9)+5+4(4)+3+5(1)$ .

The surface area of the next cube is $64$ . The surface area of the next cube is $36$ . The surface area of the next cube is $16$ . The surface area of the next cube is $4$ .

      " We can see that $44^2=1936$ which is less than 2020. Therefore, there are $2020-44=1976$ of the $4040$ numbers greater than $2020$ . Also, there are $2020+44=2064$ numbers that are less than or equal to $2020$ . Since there are $44$ duplicates/extras, it will shift up our median's placement down $44$ .

Thus, our answer is $2020.5-44=\\boxed{\\textbf{(C)}\\ 1976.5}$ . ~aryam ~Additions by BakedPotato66 As we are trying to find the median of a $4040$ -term set, we must find the average of the $2020$ th and $2021$ st terms. Since $45^2 = 2025$ is slightly greater than $2020$ , we know that the $44$ perfect squares $1^2$ through $44^2$ are less than $2020$ , and the rest are greater. Thus, from the number $1$ to the number $2020$ , there are $2020 + 44 = 2064$ terms. Since $44^2$ is $44 + 45 = 89$ less than $45^2 = 2025$ and $84$ less than $2020$ , we will only need to consider the perfect square terms going down from the $2064$ th term, $2020$ , after going down $84$ terms. Since the $2020$ th and $2021$ st terms are only $44$ and $43$ terms away from the $2064$ th term, we can simply subtract $44$ from $2020$ and $43$ from $2020$ to get the two terms, which are $1976$ and $1977$ . Averaging the two, we get $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C)}\\ 1976.5}.$  ~ emerald_block  We want to know the $2020$ th term and the $2021$ st term to get the median. We know that $44^2=1936$ . So, numbers $1^2, 2^2, \\ldots,44^2$ are in between $1$ and $1936$ . So, the sum of $44$ and $1936$ will result in $1980$ , which means that $1936$ is the $1980$ th number. Also, notice that $45^2=2025$ , which is larger than $2021$ . Then the $2020$ th term will be $1936+40 = 1976$ , and similarly the $2021$ th term will be $1977$ . Solving for the median of the two numbers, we get $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C)}\\ 1976.5}$  ~toastybaker We note that $44^2 = 1936$ , which is the largest square less than $2020$ , which means that there are $44$ additional terms before $2020$ . This makes $2020$ the $2064$ th term. To find the median, we need the $2020$ th and $2021$ st term. We note that every term before $2020$ is one less than the previous term (That is, we subtract $1$ to get the previous term.). If $2020$ is the $2064$ th term, than $2020 - 44$ is the $(2064 - 44)$ th term. So, the $2020$ th term is $1976$ , and the $2021$ st term is $1977$ , and the average of these two terms is the median, or $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C)}\\ 1976.5}$ . ~primegn To find the median, we sort the $4040$ numbers in decreasing order, then average the $2020$ th and the $2021$ st numbers of the sorted list.

Therefore, the probability of this happening is $\\frac{1}{4} \\cdot 1 = \\frac{1}{4}$ . If the frog goes to the right, it will be in the center of the square at $(2,2)$ , and by symmetry (since the frog is equidistant from all sides of the square), the chance it will hit a vertical side of a square is $\\frac{1}{2}$ .

      " AMC 12A 2020 Question-12 Solution-1.png The slope of the line is $\\frac{3}{5}$ . We must transform it by $45^{\\circ}$ . $45^{\\circ}$ creates an isosceles right triangle, since the sum of the angles of the triangle must be $180^{\\circ}$ and one angle is $90^{\\circ}$ . This means the last leg angle must also be $45^{\\circ}$ . In the isosceles right triangle, the two legs are congruent. We can therefore construct an isosceles right triangle with a line of $\\frac{3}{5}$ slope on graph paper. That line with $\\frac{3}{5}$ slope starts at $(0,0)$ and will go to $(5,3)$ , the vector $<5, 3 >$ . Construct another line from $(0,0)$ to $(3,-5)$ , the vector $<3,-5>$ . This is $\\perp$ and equal to the original line segment. The difference between the two vectors is $<2,8>$ , which is the slope $4$ , and that is the slope of line $k$ . Furthermore, the equation $3x-5y+40=0$ passes straight through $(20,20)$ since $3(20)-5(20)+40=60-100+40=0$ , which means that any rotations about $(20,20)$ would contain $(20,20)$ . We can create a line of slope $4$ through $(20,20)$ . The $x$ -intercept is therefore $20-\\frac{20}{4} = \\boxed{\\textbf{(B) } 15.}$ ~lopkiloinm ~ShawnX (diagram) Since the slope of the line is $\\frac{3}{5}$ , and the angle we are rotating around is x, then $\\tan x = \\frac{3}{5}$  $\\tan(x+45^{\\circ}) = \\frac{\\tan x + \\tan(45^{\\circ})}{1-\\tan x*\\tan(45^{\\circ})} = \\frac{0.6+1}{1-0.6} = \\frac{1.6}{0.4} = 4$  Hence, the slope of the rotated line is $4$ . Since we know the line intersects the point $(20,20)$ , then we know the line is $y=4x-60$ . Set $y=0$ to find the x-intercept, and so $x=\\boxed{15}$  ~Solution by IronicNinja [asy] draw((0,0)--(20, 0)--(20, 20)--(0, 20)--cycle); draw((20, 20)--(0, 8)); draw((15, 0)--(20, 20));  dot(\"$P$\", (20, 20)); dot(\"$A$\", (0, 8), dir(75)); dot(\"$B$\", (15, 0), dir(45)); dot(\"$X$\", (20, 0)); dot(\"$Y$\", (0, 20), dir(50)); [/asy]  Let $P$ be $(20, 20)$ and $X, Y$ be $(20, 0)$ and $(0, 20)$ respectively. Since the slope of the line is $3/5$ we know that $\\tan{\\angle{YPA}} = 3/5.$ Segments $\\overline{PA}$ and $\\overline{PB}$ represent the before and after of rotating $l$ by 45 counterclockwise. Thus, $\\angle{XPB} = 45 - \\angle{YPA}$ and \\[BX = 20 \\tan{\\angle{XPB}} = 20 \\cdot \\frac{1 - 3/5}{1 + 3/5} = 5\\] by tangent addition formula. Since $BX$ is 5 and the sidelength of the square is 20 the answer is $20 - 5 \\implies \\boxed{\\textbf{B}}.$  Using the protractor you brought, carefully graph the equation and rotate the given line $45^{\\circ}$ counter-clockwise about the point $(20,20)$ . Scaling everything down by a factor of 5 makes this process easier. It should then become fairly obvious that the x intercept is $x=\\boxed{15}$ (only use this as a last resort). ~Silverdragon First note that the given line goes through $(20,20)$ with a slope of $\\frac{3}{5}$ . This means that $(25,23)$ is on the line. Now consider translating the graph so that $(20,20)$ goes to the origin, then $(25,23)$ becomes $(5,3)$ . We now rotate the line $45^\\circ$ about the origin using a rotation matrix. This maps $(5,3)$ to \\[\\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} & -\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\\\ \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} & \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\end{bmatrix}\\begin{bmatrix} 5 \\\\ 3\\end{bmatrix}=\\begin{bmatrix}\\sqrt{2} \\\\ 4\\sqrt{2}\\end{bmatrix}\\] The line through the origin and $(\\sqrt{2}, 4\\sqrt{2})$ has slope $4$ . Translating this line so that the origin is mapped to $(20,20)$ , we find that the equation for the new line is $4x-60$ , meaning that the $x$ -intercept is $x=\\frac{60}{4}=\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }15}$ . Note $(20,20)$ is on the line.  Construct the perpendicular line $5x+3y-160=0$ .  This creates a right triangle that intersects the x-axis at $(\\frac{-40}{3},0)$ and $(32,0)$ a distance of $136/3$ apart.  The $45^\\circ$ transformation will bisect the right angle.\n",
      "The angle bisector theorem tells us the $136$ will split in ratio to the lengths of the sides.\n",
      "These are $\\sqrt{12^2+20^2}$ and $\\sqrt{\\frac{100}{3}^2 + 20^2} = 4\\sqrt{34}$ and $\\frac{20}{3}\\sqrt{34}$ .  Thus the x intercept will split the line from $\\frac{-40}{3}$ to $32$ into a ratio of $5:3$ making the x-intercept $15$ . Converting to the complex plane, we can see that two numbers on the line are $8i$ and $5+11i$ . Translating $20+20i$ to the origin, we get $8i-20-20i = -20-12i$ and $5+11i-20-20i = -15-9i$ . Multiplying each of them by $e^{\\pi i/4}$ , we get $-4\\sqrt 2 - 16 \\sqrt2 i$ and $-3\\sqrt 2 - 12 \\sqrt 2 i$ . This line has a slope of $4$ . Now, back to the cartesian plane. We have a line passing through $(20, 20)$ with slope $4$ which gives the equation as $y = 4x-60$ which implies the $x$ coordinate of the $x$ intercept is $60/4 = 15$ . ~rocketsri (minor error corrected by kn07) A quick check tells us that $(20,20)$ falls on the given line. Common sense tells us that if the slope of the original line is $1$ , or 45 degrees from the horizontal, a 45 counter clockwise rotation will result in a vertical line, and the x-intercept will be $(20,0)$ . \n",
      "Thinking of a 45 degree counter clockwise rotation as a 90 degree counter clockwise rotation that is bisected will helps in visualizing this line of reasoning.\n",
      "Therefore, it follows that if the original line is made steeper, then the x-intercept will move away from $(20,0)$ to the right. If the original line is made lower, then the opposite will happen. Our given line has slope $3/5$ , so the answer must be $A$ or $B$ . $A$ can be eliminated because an x-intercept of $(10,0)$ can only occur when the original line is horizontal. In conclusion, the answer must be $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }15}$ . ~jackshi2006\n",

      " $\\sqrt[a]{N\\sqrt[b]{N\\sqrt[c]{N}}}$ can be simplified to $N^{\\frac{1}{a}+\\frac{1}{ab}+\\frac{1}{abc}}.$  The equation is then $N^{\\frac{1}{a}+\\frac{1}{ab}+\\frac{1}{abc}}=N^{\\frac{25}{36}}$ which implies that $\\frac{1}{a}+\\frac{1}{ab}+\\frac{1}{abc}=\\frac{25}{36}.$  $a$ has to be $2$ since $\\frac{25}{36}>\\frac{7}{12}$ . $\\frac{7}{12}$ is the result when $a, b,$ and $c$ are $3, 2,$ and $2$  $b$ being $3$ will make the fraction $\\frac{2}{3}$ which is close to $\\frac{25}{36}$ . Finally, with $c$ being $6$ , the fraction becomes $\\frac{25}{36}$ . In this case $a, b,$ and $c$ work, which means that $b$ must equal $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) } 3.}$ ~lopkiloinm As above, notice that you get $\\frac{1}{a}+\\frac{1}{ab}+\\frac{1}{abc}=\\frac{25}{36}.$  Now, combine the fractions to get $\\frac{bc+c+1}{abc}=\\frac{25}{36}$ . Let us assume $bc+c+1=25$ and $abc=36$ as this is the most convenient. (EDIT: This used to say WLOG but that is inaccurate) From the first equation, we get $c(b+1)=24$ . Note also that from the second equation, $b$ and $c$ must be factors of 36. After listing out the factors of 36 and utilising trial and error, we find that $c=6$ and $b=3$ works, with $a=2$ . So our answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) } 3.}$  ~Silverdragon Edits by ~Snore, ~Swaggergotcha Collapsed, $\\sqrt[a]{N\\sqrt[b]{N\\sqrt[c]{N}}} = \\sqrt[abc]{N^{bc+c+1}}$ . Comparing this to $\\sqrt[36]{N^{25}}$ , observe that $bc+c+1=25$ and $abc=36$ . The first can be rewritten as $c(b+1)=24$ . Then, $b+1$ has to factor into 24 while 1 less than that also must factor into 36. The prime factorizations are as follows $36=2^2 3^2$ and $24=2^33$ . Then, $b=\\boxed{\\textbf{B)}3}$ , as only 4 and 3 factor into 36 and 24 while being 1 apart. ~~BJHHar Note: 3 and 2 also factor into 24 and 36 while being 1 apart, but we can eliminate by quick guess and check. ~ Edit by Soupnoodle $\\sqrt[a]{N\\sqrt[b]{N\\sqrt[c]{N}}} = \\sqrt[36]{N^{25}}$ can be rewritten as $\\frac{\\frac{\\frac{1}{c}+1}{b}+1}{a} = \\frac{25}{36}$ . The trick is to focus on the properties of the denominators and numerators. $a$ must be either be a factor of 36, because in any other situation the denominator of the final expression is preserved, and $b$ is forced to be 36, which is not an answer choice. Next, realize that the numerator of $\\frac{\\frac{1}{c}+1}{b}+1$ must be $25$ , and even more importantly, that the denominator must be large enough so that when $1$ is subtracted from it, it will form a fraction less than $1$ . The only number large enough to do this will also being a fraction of $36$ is 18. This means that $a$ is 2. Moving onward, we are left with $\\frac{\\frac{1}{c}+1}{b} = \\frac{7}{18}$ . Since $b$ must be a factor of $18$ , just plug in values from the answer choices to find that $c=6$ and $b=3$ . ~jackshi2006\n",

      " $ACEG$ is a square. WLOG $AB = 1,$ then using Law of Cosines, $AC^2 = [ACEG] = 1^2 + 1^2 - 2 \\cos{135} = 2 + \\sqrt{2}.$ The area of the octagon is just $[ACEG]$ plus the area of the four congruent (by symmetry) isosceles triangles, all an angle of $135$ in between two sides of length 1. Now, \\[\\dfrac{m}{n} = \\dfrac{2 + \\sqrt{2}}{2 + \\sqrt{2} + 4 \\cdot \\tfrac{1}{2} \\sin{135}} = \\dfrac{2 + \\sqrt{2}}{2 + 2 \\sqrt{2}} = \\dfrac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}.\\] The answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B)}}.$  Refer to the diagram. Call one of the side lengths of the square $s$ . Since quadrilateral ACEG is a square, the area of the square would just be $s^2$ , which we can find by applying Law of Cosines on one of the four triangles. Assume each of the sides of the octagon has length $1$ . Since each angle measures $135^{\\circ}$ in an octagon, then $s^2 = 1^2+1^2-2*\\cos(135^{\\circ}) = 2+\\sqrt{2}$  There are many ways to find the area of the octagon, but one way is to split the octagon into two trapezoids and one rectangle. We can easily compute AF to be $1+\\sqrt{2}$ from splitting one of the sides into two $45-45-90$ triangles. So the area of the octagon is $2*\\frac{1+\\sqrt{2}}{2}+1+\\sqrt{2} \\Rightarrow 2+2\\sqrt{2}$ . Hence, \\[\\frac{m}{n} = \\frac{2+\\sqrt{2}}{2+2\\sqrt{2}}\\]  \\[\\Rightarrow \\frac{2+\\sqrt{2}}{2+2\\sqrt{2}} \\cdot \\frac{2-2\\sqrt{2}}{2-2\\sqrt{2}}\\]  \\[\\Rightarrow \\frac{-2\\sqrt{2}}{-4}\\]  \\[\\Rightarrow \\boxed{\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}}\\]  ~Solution by IronicNinja [asy] draw((1, 2.41421356)--(2.41421356, 1)--(2.41421356, -1)--(1, -2.41421356)--(-1, -2.41421356)--(-2.41421356, -1)--(-2.41421356, 1)--(-1, 2.41421356)--cycle); draw((2.41421356, 1)--(1, -2.41421356)--(-2.41421356, -1)--(-1, 2.41421356)--cycle); label(\"A\",(-1, 2.41421356),NW); label(\"B\",(1, 2.41421356),NE); label(\"C\",(2.41421356, 1),NE); label(\"D\",(2.41421356, -1),SE); label(\"E\",(1,-2.41421356),SE); label(\"F\",(-1,-2.41421356),SW); label(\"G\",(-2.41421356,-1),SW); label(\"H\",(-2.41421356,1),NW); [/asy]  The first thing to notice is that $ACEG$ is a square. This is because, as $\\bigtriangleup ABC \\cong \\bigtriangleup CDE \\cong \\bigtriangleup EFG \\cong \\bigtriangleup GHE$ , they all have the same base, meaning that $AC = DE = EG = GA$ . Hence, we have that it is a square. To determine the area of this square, we can determine the length of its diagonals. In order to do this, we first determine the area of the octagon. Letting the side length be $a$ , we can create a square of length $s$ around it (see figure). [asy] draw((1, 2.41421356)--(2.41421356, 1)--(2.41421356, -1)--(1, -2.41421356)--(-1, -2.41421356)--(-2.41421356, -1)--(-2.41421356, 1)--(-1, 2.41421356)--cycle); label(\"a\",(1, 2.41421356)--(2.41421356, 1),S); draw((-2.41421356, 2.41421356)--(2.41421356, 2.41421356)--(2.41421356, -2.41421356)--(-2.41421356, -2.41421356)--cycle); label(\"s\",(-2.41421356, 2.41421356)--(2.41421356, 2.41421356),N); [/asy]  Creating a small square of side length $a$ from the corners of this figure gives us an area of $a^2$ . Thus, $s^2 - a^2 = n$ where $n$ is the area of the octagon. We know from the Pythagorean Theorem that $s = a + \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{2}}$ , meaning that $n = (a + \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{2}})^2 - a^2 = 2a^2(1+\\sqrt{2})$ . Dividing this by $8$ gives us the area of each triangular segment which makes up the octagon. Further dividing by $2$ gives us the area of a smaller segment consisting of the right triangle with legs of the apothem and $\\frac{a}{2}$ . Using the area of a triangle as $\\frac{1}{2}bh$ , we can determine the length of apothem $r$ from \\[\\frac{2a^2(1+\\sqrt{2})}{8 \\times 2} = \\frac{\\frac{a}{2}\\times r}{2}\\]  \\[\\frac{4a^2(1+\\sqrt{2})}{8 } = ar\\]  \\[\\frac{a(1+\\sqrt{2})}{2} = r\\] . From the apothem, we can once again use the Pythagorean Theorem, giving us the length of the circumradius $R$ . \\[R^2 = (\\frac{a(1+\\sqrt{2})}{2})^2 + (\\frac{a}{2})^2\\]  \\[R^2 = \\frac{a^2(1+\\sqrt{2})^2}{4} + \\frac{a^2}{4}\\]  \\[R^2 = \\frac{a^2(3+2\\sqrt{2})}{4} + \\frac{a^2}{4}\\]  \\[R^2 = \\frac{a^2(4+2\\sqrt{2})}{4}\\]  \\[R = \\sqrt{\\frac{a^2(4+2\\sqrt{2})}{4}} = \\frac{a\\sqrt{4 + 2\\sqrt2}}{2}\\] . Doubling this gives us the diagonal of both the square and the octagon. From here, we can use the formula $A = \\frac{1}{2}d^2$ for the area of the square: \\[A = \\frac{(a\\sqrt{4 + 2\\sqrt2})^2}{2}\\]  \\[A = \\frac{a^2(4+2\\sqrt{2})}{2} = m\\] . Thus we now only need to find the ratio $\\frac{m}{n}$ . This can be easily done through some algebra: \\[\\frac{m}{n} = \\frac{a^2(4+2\\sqrt{2})}{2(2a^2(1+\\sqrt{2})}\\]  \\[\\frac{m}{n} = \\frac{4+2\\sqrt{2}}{4+4\\sqrt{2}}\\]  \\[\\frac{m}{n} = \\frac{2+\\sqrt{2}}{2+2\\sqrt{2}}\\]  Rationalizing the denominator by multiplying by the conjugate, we get $\\frac{m}{n} = \\boxed{\\textbf{(B) } \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}}$ . ~ciceronii $\\textbf{Note:}$ this can more easily be done if you know any of these formulas. This was an entire derivation of the area of an octagon, it's apothem, and it's circumradius, but it can be much simpler if you have any of these memorized. WLOG, let $AE=1$ . Let the intersection of $AF$ and $GD$ be point $I$ . $GIF$ is an isosceles right triangle ( $m\\angle HGF=135^{\\circ}$ ), so $IG=IF=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$ . The distance between each side and the center is then $IF+\\frac{1}{2}GH=\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$ . $ABCDEFGH$ is 8 triangles of base 1 and altitude $\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$ , so its area is $8(\\frac{1}{2})(\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}})$ or \\[2+2\\sqrt{2}\\] Similarly, $ACEG$ is clearly a  square of area $GA^2$ . By the Pythagorean Theorem, $GA^2=GI^2+IA^2=(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}})^2+(1+\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}})^2$ or \\[2+\\sqrt{2}\\]  \\[\\frac{m}{n} = \\frac{2+\\sqrt{2}}{2+2\\sqrt{2}}\\] From some fast manipulations, see that it is $\\boxed{\\textbf{B)}\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{{2}}}$  ~~BJHHar This solution is quite efficient and unconvoluted. Though the explanation appears long, this is only because I have tried to make it very thorough. Because we are finding the ratios of the areas of the quadrilateral, and the octagon, let us assume, for simplicity's sake, that the octagon has side length $1$ . Call $O$ the center of the octagon. Because it is a regular octagon, $\\angle AOB$ is $\\frac{360}{8}=45$ . \n",
      "Draw the apothem, and call where it intersects $AB$ , $I$ . As the apothem bisects $\\angle AOB$ , $\\angle AIB$ is $\\frac{45}{2}=22.5$ . \n",
      "Then, as the apothem is perpendicular to $AB$ , $/angle IBO$ is $90-22.5=67.5$ . As the apothem bisects $AB$ , segment $IB$ is $\\frac{1}{2}$ . Thus, the apothem has length $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\text{tan}(67.5)$ . By the formula $\\text{area} = \\text{apothem} \\cdot \\frac{\\text{perimeter}}{2}$ , the area of the octagon is then $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\text{tan}(67.5) \\cdot \\frac{8}{2}$ . Now, we move on to the quadrilateral. Let us take triangle $AGH$ . By the interior angle formula, $m \\angle AGH = \\frac{180 (8-2)}{8} = 135$ . Because the octagon is regular, $AGH$ is isosceles, with assumed sidelength $1$ . Drop an altitude from $H$ to $AG$ , and call the intersection point, $P$ . As $AGH$ is isosceles, this altitude bisects both segment $AG$ and angle $AHG$ . Thus, the $m \\angle AHP = \\frac{135}{2} = 67.5$ . Let us call the length of $AG$ , which is also a side of the quadrilateral, $s$ . Then, $AP$ is $\\frac{s}{2}$ . Thus, $\\text{sin}(67.5) = \\frac{\\frac{s}{2}}{1}$ , so $s = 2 \\cdot \\text{sin}(67.5)$ . We can do the same for each of the other sides of the quadrilateral and find that they are of the same length. One can easily see that triangle $ABC$ is congruent to triangle $AGH$ . Because triangle $AGH$ is isosceles, $m \\angle HAG = \\frac{180-135}{2} = 22.5$ . The same can be said of angles $BAC$ . Thus, angle $CAG$ , an interior angle of the quadrilateral is $90$ .

Solution 1 We consider an individual one-by-one block. If we draw a quarter of a circle from each corner (where the lattice points are located), each with radius $d$ , the area covered by the circles should be $0.5$ . Because of this, and the fact that there are four circles, we write \\[4 \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot \\pi d^2 = \\frac{1}{2}\\]  Solving for $d$ , we obtain $d = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}$ , where with $\\pi \\approx 3$ , we get $d \\approx \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}} \\approx \\dfrac{1}{2.5} = \\dfrac{10}{25} = \\dfrac{2}{5}$ , and from here, we see that $d \\approx 0.4 \\implies \\boxed{\\textbf{(B) } 0.4}.$  ~Crypthes ~ Minor Edits by BakedPotato66 $\\textbf{Note:}$ To be more rigorous, note that $d<0.5$ since if $d\\geq0.5$ then clearly the probability is greater than $\\frac{1}{2}$ . This would make sure the above solution works, as if $d\\geq0.5$ there is overlap with the quartercircles. $\\textbf{- Emathmaster}$  Solution 2 As in the previous solution, we obtain the equation $4 \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot \\pi d^2 = \\frac{1}{2}$ , which simplifies to $\\pi d^2 = \\frac{1}{2} = 0.5$ . Since $\\pi$ is slightly more than $3$ , $d^2$ is slightly less than $\\frac{0.5}{3} = 0.1\\bar{6}$ . We notice that $0.1\\bar{6}$ is slightly more than $0.4^2 = 0.16$ , so $d$ is roughly $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) } 0.4}.$ ~ emerald_block  Solution 3 (Estimating) As above, we find that we need to estimate $d = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}$ . Note that we can approximate $2\\pi \\approx 6.28318 \\approx 6.25$ and so $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}$  $\\approx \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6.25}}=\\frac{1}{2.5}=0.4$ . And so our answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) } 0.4}$ . ~Silverdragon Solution 4 (Estimating but a bit different) We only need to figure out the probability for a unit square, as it will scale up to the $2020\\times 2020$ square. Since we want to find the probability that a point inside a unit square that is $d$ units away from a lattice point (a corner of the square) is $\\frac{1}{2}$ , we can find which answer will come the closest to covering $\\frac{1}{2}$ of the area. Since the closest is $0.4$ which turns out to be $(0.4)^2\\times \\pi = 0.16 \\times \\pi$ which is about $0.502$ , we find that the answer rounded to the nearest tenth is $0.4$ or $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B)}}$ . ~RuiyangWu Solution 5 (Estimating but differently again) As per the above diagram, realize that $\\pi d^2 = \\frac{1}{2}$ , so $d = \\frac{1}{(\\sqrt{2})(\\sqrt{\\pi})}$ . $\\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.4 = \\frac{7}{5}$ . $\\sqrt{\\pi}$ is between $1.7$ and $1.8$  $((1.7)^2 = 2.89$ and $(1.8)^2 = 3.24)$ , so we can say $\\sqrt{\\pi} \\approx 1.75 = \\frac{7}{4}$ . So $d \\approx \\frac{1}{(\\frac{7}{5})(\\frac{7}{4})} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{49}{20}} = \\frac{20}{49}$ . This is slightly above $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) } 0.4}$ , since $\\frac{20}{49} \\approx \\frac{2}{5}$ . -Solution by Joeya Solution 6 (Estimating but differently again, again) As above, we have the equation $\\pi d^2 = \\frac{1}{2}$ , and we want to find the most accurate value of $d$ . We resort to the answer choices and can plug those values of $d$ in and see which value of $d$ will lead to the most accurate value of $\\pi$ . Starting off in the middle, we try option C with $d=0.5$ . Plugging this in, we get $\\pi \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{2},$ and after simplifying we get $\\pi = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 4 = 2.$ That's not very good. We know $\\pi \\approx 3.14.$  Let's see if we can do better. Trying option A with $d = 0.3,$ we get $\\pi = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{100}{9} = \\frac{50}{9} = 5 \\frac{5}{9}.$  Hm, let's try option B with $d = 0.4.$ We get $\\pi = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{25}{4} = \\frac{25}{8} = 3 \\frac{1}{8}$ . This is very close to $\\pi$ and is the best estimate for $\\pi$ of the 5 options. Therefore, the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) } 0.4}.$ ~ epiconan Let $n$ be the side length of a square.

There are $(n-1)^2$ full circles on the inside, $4(n-1)$ semicircles on the sides, and $4$ quarter circles for the corners. Full circles are, of course, worth one circle. Semicircles are worth half a circle each, and quarter circles are worth $\\dfrac14$ of a circle. Thus, weighing our sum gives $(n-1)^2+\\dfrac{4(n-1)}2+\\dfrac44=n^2-2n+1+2(n-1)+1=n^2-2n+2n+2-2=n^2.$ Thus, there is $n^2\\cdot\\pi r^2$ worth of the shaded area for any $n$ , and since the area of each circle is $\\pi r^2$ if $r$ is the radius of each. We want the ratio of this shaded area to the entire to be $\\dfrac12$ . The area of the entire square is $n^2$ , so dividing, we see that $\\dfrac{n^2\\cdot\\pi r^2}{n^2}=\\pi r^2=\\dfrac12$ .

Now, if we redraw another diagram just of $ABC$ , we get that $(2x)^2=(5-x)(15+x)$ because of the altitude geometric mean theorem which states that in any right triangle, the altitude squared is equal to the product of the two lengths that it divides the base into. Expanding, simplifying, and dividing by the GCF, we get $x^2+2x-15=0$ . This factors to $(x+5)(x-3)$ , which has roots of $x=-5, 3$ . Since lengths cannot be negative, $x=3$ .

However, now we have an extra term of $2^{18}$ on the right from $2^{a_1+17}$ . To cancel it, we let $a_2 = 18$ . The two $2^{18}$ 's now combine into a term of $2^{19}$ , so we let $a_3 = 19$ . And so on, until we get to $a_{18} = 34$ . Now everything we don't want telescopes into $2^{35}$ . We already have that term since we let $a_2 = 18 \\implies a_2+17 = 35$ . Everything from now on will automatically telescope to $2^{52}$ . So we let $a_{19}$ be $52$ . As you can see, we will have to add $17$  $a_n$ 's at a time, then \"wait\" for the sum to automatically telescope for the next $17$ numbers, etc, until we get to $2^{289}$ .

This is because every time we reflect $T$ , it changes orientation. Once $T$ has been flipped once, no combination of rotations will put it back in place because it is the mirror image; however, flipping it again changes it back to the original orientation. Since we are only allowed $3$ transformations and an even number of them must be reflections, we either reflect $T$  $0$ times or $2$ times.  Case 1: $0$ reflections on $T$ .  In this case, we must use $3$ rotations to return $T$ to its original position. Notice that our set of rotations, $\\{90^\\circ,180^\\circ,270^\\circ\\}$ , contains every multiple of $90^\\circ$ except for $0^\\circ$ . We can start with any two rotations $a,b$ in $\\{90^\\circ,180^\\circ,270^\\circ\\}$ and there must be exactly one $c \\equiv -a - b \\pmod{360^\\circ}$ such that we can use the three rotations $(a,b,c)$ which ensures that $a + b + c \\equiv 0^\\circ \\pmod{360^\\circ}$ . That way, the composition of rotations $a,b,c$ yields a full rotation. For example, if $a = b = 90^\\circ$ , then $c \\equiv -90^\\circ - 90^\\circ = -180^\\circ \\pmod{360^\\circ}$ , so $c = 180^\\circ$ and the rotations $(90^\\circ,90^\\circ,180^\\circ)$ yields a full rotation. The only case in which this fails is when $c$ would have to equal $0^\\circ$ . This happens when $(a,b)$ is already a full rotation, namely, $(a,b) = (90^\\circ,270^\\circ),(180^\\circ,180^\\circ),$ or $(270^\\circ,90^\\circ)$ . However, we can simply subtract these three cases from the total. Selecting $(a,b)$ from $\\{90^\\circ,180^\\circ,270^\\circ\\}$ yields $3 \\cdot 3 = 9$ choices, and with $3$ that fail, we are left with $6$ combinations for case $1$ .  Case 2: $2$ reflections on $T$ .  In this case, we first eliminate the possibility of having two of the same reflection. Since two reflections across the x-axis maps $T$ back to itself, inserting a rotation before, between, or after these two reflections would change $T$ 's final location, meaning that any combination involving two reflections across the x-axis would not map $T$ back to itself. The same applies to two reflections across the y-axis. Therefore, we must use one reflection about the x-axis, one reflection about the y-axis, and one rotation. Since a reflection about the x-axis changes the sign of the y component, a reflection about the y-axis changes the sign of the x component, and a $180^\\circ$ rotation changes both signs, these three transformation composed (in any order) will suffice. It is therefore only a question of arranging the three, giving us $3! = 6$ combinations for case 2. Combining both cases we get $6+6=\\boxed{\\textbf{(A)}  12}$ . As in the previous solution, note that we must have either $0$ or $2$ reflections because of orientation since reflection changes orientation that is impossible to fix by rotation. We also know we can't have the same reflection twice, since that would give a net of no change and would require an identity rotation. Suppose there are no reflections. Denote $90^{\\circ}$ as $1$ , $180^{\\circ}$ as $2$ , and $270^{\\circ}$ as $3$ , just for simplification purposes. We want a combination of $3$ of these that will sum to either $4$ or $8$ ( $0$ and $12$ are impossible since the minimum is $3$ and the max is $9$ ). $4$ can be achieved with any permutation of $(1-1-2)$ and $8$ can be achieved with any permutation of $(2-3-3)$ . This case can be done in $3+3=6$ ways. Suppose there are two reflections. As noted already, they must be different, and as a result will take the triangle to the opposite side of the origin if we don't do any rotation. We have $1$ rotation left that we can do though, and the only one that will return to the original position is $2$ , which is $180^{\\circ}$ AKA reflection across origin. Therefore, since all $3$ transformations are distinct. The three transformations can be applied anywhere since they are commutative (think quadrants). This gives $6$ ways. $6+6=\\boxed{\\textbf{(A)}  12}$ . Define $s$ as a reflection, and $r$ as a $90^{\\circ}$ counterclockwise rotation. Thus, $r^4=s^2=e$ , and the five transformations can be represented as ${r, r^2, r^3, r^2s, s}$ , and $rs=sr^{-1}$ . Now either $s$ doesn't appear at all or appears twice. For the former case, it's easy to see that only $r, r, r^2$ and $r^2, r^3, r^3$ will work. Both can be permuted in $3$ ways, giving $6$ ways in total. For the latter case, note that $s$ can't appear twice, neither does $r^2s$ , else we need to get $e$ from ${r, r^2, r^3}$ , which is not possible. So $r^2s$ and $s$ must appear once each. The last transformation must be $r^2$ . A quick check shows that ${r^2, r^2s, s}$ is permutable, since $r^2s=sr^{-2}=sr^2$ (since $r^4=e$ ). This gives $6$ ways. Thus the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A)} 12}$ . ~Xrider100 https://youtu.be/yAkj_5YMhhQ  https://youtu.be/SBhkM2frTUA  https://artofproblemsolving.com/videos/amc/2020amc10a/513  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXwvTmFvo0c \n",

Next, we must find exactly how many different possibilities exist for each. There can be anywhere between $3$ and $8$  $2$ 's and $1$ to $4$  $3$ 's. However, since $n$ is a multiple of $5$ , and we multiply the $\\text{gcd}$ by $5$ , there can only be $3$  $5$ 's in $n$ 's prime factorization. Finally, there can either $0$ or $1$  $7$ 's. Thus, we can multiply the total possibilities of $n$ 's factorization to determine the number of integers $n$ which satisfy the equation, giving us $6 \\times 4 \\times 1 \\times 2 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(D) } 48}$ . ~ciceronii Like the Solution 1, we start from the equation: \\[\\text{lcm}{(5!, n)} = 5\\text{gcd}{(10!, n)}.\\] Assume $\\text{lcm}{(5!, n)}=k\\cdot5!$ , with some integer $k$ . It follows that $k\\cdot 4!=\\text{gcd}{(10!, n)}$ . It means that $n$ has a divisor $4!$ . Since $n$ is a multiple of $5$ , $n$ has a divisor $5!$ . Thus, $\\text{lcm}{(5!, n)}=n=k\\cdot5!$ . The equation can be changed as \\[k\\cdot5!=5\\text{gcd}{(10!, k\\cdot5!)}\\]  \\[k=5\\text{gcd}{(6\\cdot7\\cdot8\\cdot9\\cdot10, k)}\\] We can see that $k$ is also a multiple of $5$ , with a form of $5\\cdot m$ . Substituting it in the above equation, we have \\[m=5\\text{gcd}{(6\\cdot7\\cdot8\\cdot9\\cdot2, m)}\\] Similarly, $m$ is a multiple of $5$ , with a form of $5\\cdot s$ . We have \\[s=\\text{gcd}{(6\\cdot7\\cdot8\\cdot9\\cdot2, 5\\cdot s)}=\\text{gcd}{(2^5\\cdot3^3\\cdot7, s)}\\] The equation holds, if $s$ is a divisor of $2^5\\cdot3^3\\cdot7$ , which has $(5+1)(3+1)(1+1)=\\boxed{(\\textbf{D})48}$ divisors. ~Linty Huang As in the previous solutions, we start with \\[\\text{lcm}(5!,n) = 5\\text{gcd}(10!,n)\\]  From this we have that $\\text{lcm}(5!,n) \\,|\\, 5\\text{gcd}(10!,n)$ , and in particular, $n \\,|\\, 5\\text{gcd}(10!,n)$ . However, $\\text{gcd}(10!,n)\\, |\\, n$ , so we must have $\\text{gcd}(10!,n) = n$ or $\\text{gcd}(10!,n) = n/5$ . If $\\text{gcd}(10!,n) = n$ , then we have $\\text{lcm}(5!,n) = 5n$ ; because $5\\, |\\, 5!$ , this implies that 5 does not divide $n$ , so we must have $\\text{gcd}(10!,n) = n/5$ . Now we have $\\text{lcm}(5!,n) = n$ , implying that $5!\\, |\\, n$ , and $n/5\\, |\\, 10!$ . Writing out prime factorizations, this gives us \\[2^3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\,|\\, n\\]  \\[n \\,|\\, 2^8 \\cdot 3^4 \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 7\\]  So $n$ can have 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 factors of 2; 1, 2, 3, or 4 factors of two; and 0 or 1 factors of 7. Note that $\\text{gcd}(2^8 \\cdot 3^4 \\cdot 5^2 \\cdot 7,n) = n/5$ implies that $n$ has 2 factors of 5. Thus, there are $6 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 2 = 48$ possible choices for $n$ , and our answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) 48}}$ . -gumbymoo https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S85536jpYw&list=PLyhPcpM8aMvJvwA2kypmfdtlxH90ShZCc&index=1&t=25s - AMBRIGGS https://youtu.be/CWZkTCNu42o?t=846  ~ pi_is_3.14\n",

      " Consider the probability that rolling two dice gives a sum of $s$ , where $s \\leq 7$ . There are $s - 1$ pairs that satisfy this, namely $(1, s - 1), (2, s - 2), \\ldots, (s - 1, 1)$ , out of $6^2 = 36$ possible pairs. The probability is $\\frac{s - 1}{36}$ . Therefore, if one die has a value of $a$ and Jason rerolls the other two dice, then the probability of winning is $\\frac{7 - a - 1}{36} = \\frac{6 - a}{36}$ . In order to maximize the probability of winning, $a$ must be minimized. This means that if Jason rerolls two dice, he must choose the two dice with the maximum values. Thus, we can let $a \\leq b \\leq c$ be the values of the three dice. Consider the case when $a + b < 7$ . If $a + b + c = 7$ , then we do not need to reroll any dice. Otherwise,\n",
      "if we reroll one die, we can reroll any one dice in the hope that we get the value that makes the sum of the three dice $7$ . This happens with probability $\\frac16$ . If we reroll two dice, we will roll the two maximum dice, and the probability of winning is $\\frac{6 - a}{36}$ , as stated above. However, $\\frac16 > \\frac{6 - a}{36}$ , so rolling one die is always better than rolling two dice if $a + b < 7$ . Now consider the case where $a + b \\geq 7$ . Rerolling one die will not help us win since the sum of the three dice will always be greater than $7$ . If we reroll two dice, the probability of winning is, once again, $\\frac{6 - a}{36}$ . To find the probability of winning if we reroll all three dice, we can let each dice have $1$ dot and find the number of ways to distribute the remaining $4$ dots. By stars and bars, there are ${6\\choose2} = 15$ ways to do this, making the probability of winning $\\frac{15}{6^3} = \\frac5{72}$ . In order for rolling two dice to be more favorable than rolling three dice, $\\frac{6 - a}{36} > \\frac5{72} \\rightarrow a \\leq 3$ . Thus, rerolling two dice is optimal if and only if $a \\leq 3$ and $a + b \\geq 7$ . The possible triplets $(a, b, c)$ that satisfy these conditions, and the number of ways they can be permuted, are $(3, 4, 4) \\rightarrow 3$ ways. $(3, 4, 5) \\rightarrow 6$ ways. $(3, 4, 6) \\rightarrow 6$ ways. $(3, 5, 5) \\rightarrow 3$ ways. $(3, 5, 6) \\rightarrow 6$ ways. $(3, 6, 6) \\rightarrow 3$ ways. $(2, 5, 5) \\rightarrow 3$ ways. $(2, 5, 6) \\rightarrow 6$ ways. $(2, 6, 6) \\rightarrow 3$ ways. $(1, 6, 6) \\rightarrow 3$ ways. There are $3 + 6 + 6 + 3 + 6 + 3 + 3 + 6 + 3 + 3 = 42$ ways in which rerolling two dice is optimal, out of $6^3 = 216$ possibilities, Therefore, the probability that Jason will reroll two dice is $\\frac{42}{216} = \\boxed{\\textbf{(A) } \\frac{7}{36}}$ . We conclude all of the following after the initial roll:  Jason rerolls exactly zero dice if and only if the sum of the three dice is $7,$ in which the probability of winning is always $1.$  If Jason rerolls exactly one die, then the sum of the two other dice must be $2,3,4,5,$ or $6.$ The probability of winning is always $\\frac16,$ as exactly $1$ of the $6$ possible outcomes of the die rerolled results in a win.  If Jason rerolls exactly two dice, then the outcome of the remaining die must be $1,2,3,4,$ or $5.$ Applying casework to the remaining die produces the following table: \\[\\begin{array}{c||c|c} & & \\\\ [-2.5ex] \\textbf{Remaining Die} & \\textbf{Sum Needed for the Two Dice Rerolled} & \\textbf{Probability of Winning} \\\\ [0.5ex] \\hline & & \\\\ [-2ex] 1 & 6 & 5/36 \\\\ 2 & 5 & 4/36 \\\\ 3 & 4 & 3/36 \\\\ 4 & 3 & 2/36 \\\\ 5 & 2 & 1/36 \\end{array}\\] The probability of winning is at most $\\frac{5}{36}.$  If Jason (re)rolls all three dice, then the probability of winning is always $\\frac{\\binom62}{6^3}=\\frac{15}{216}=\\frac{5}{72}.$ For the denominator, rolling three dice gives a total of $6^3=216$ possible outcomes. For the numerator, this is the same as counting the ordered triples of positive integers $(a,b,c)$ for which $a+b+c=7.$ Suppose that $7$ balls are lined up in a row. There are $6$ gaps between the balls, and placing dividers in $2$ of the gaps separates the balls into $3$ piles. From left to right, the numbers of balls in the piles correspond to $a,b,$ and $c,$ respectively. There are $\\binom62=15$ ways to place the dividers. Note that the dividers' positions and the ordered triples have one-to-one correspondence, and $1\\leq a,b,c\\leq6$ holds for all such ordered triples.  The optimal strategy is that:  If Jason needs to reroll at least zero dice to win, then he rerolls exactly zero dice.  If Jason needs to reroll at least one die to win, then he rerolls exactly one die.  If Jason needs to reroll at least two dice to win, then he rerolls exactly two dice if and only if the probability of winning is greater than $\\frac{5}{72},$ the probability of winning for rerolling all three dice. The first three cases in the table above satisfy this requirement. We will analyze these cases by considering the initial outcomes of the two dice rerolled. Note that any of the three dice can be the remaining die, so we need a factor of $3$ for all counts in the third column: \\[\\begin{array}{c||c|c}  & & \\\\ [-2.5ex]  \\textbf{Remaining Die} & \\textbf{Initial Outcomes of the Two Dice Rerolled} & \\textbf{\\# of Ways} \\\\ [0.5ex]  \\hline  & & \\\\ [-2ex]  1 & \\text{Both are in }\\{6\\}\\text{, not necessarily distinct.} & 3\\cdot1^2=3 \\\\  2 & \\text{Both are in }\\{5,6\\}\\text{, not necessarily distinct.} & \\hspace{2mm}3\\cdot2^2=12 \\\\  3 & \\text{Both are in }\\{4,5,6\\}\\text{, not necessarily distinct.} & \\hspace{2mm}3\\cdot3^2=27 \\end{array}\\]   Finally, the requested probability is \\[\\frac{3+12+27}{6^3}=\\frac{42}{216}=\\boxed{\\textbf{(A) } \\frac{7}{36}}.\\]  ~MRENTHUSIASM We count the numerator.\n",
      "Jason will pick up no dice if he already has a $7$ as a sum. We need to assume he does not have a $7$ to begin with.\n",
      "If Jason decides to pick up all the dice to re-roll, by the stars and bars rule ways to distribute, ${n+k-1 \\choose k-1}$ , there will be $2$ bars and $4$ stars ( $3$ of them need to be guaranteed because a roll is at least $1$ ) for a probability of $\\frac{15}{216}=\\frac{2.5}{36}$ .\n",

      "If the roll is not $7$ , Jason will pick up exactly one die to re-roll if there can remain two other dice with sum less than $7$ , since this will give him a $\\frac{1}{6}$ chance which is a larger probability than all the cases unless he has a $7$ to begin with.\n",

      "When $a=1$ , there are $3$ choices for whether it is rolled $1$ st, $2$ nd, or $3$ rd, and in this case the other two rolls have to be at least $6$ (or he would have only picked up $1$ ). This give $3 \\cdot 1^{2} =3$ ways.\n",
      "Similarly, $a=2$ gives $3 \\cdot 2^{2} =12$ because the $2$ can be rolled in $3$ places and the other two rolls are at least $5$ . $a=3$ gives $3 \\cdot 3^{2} =27$ . \n",

      "The denominator is $6^3=216$ , so we have $\\frac{42}{216}=\\boxed{\\textbf{(A) } \\frac{7}{36}}$ . We can quickly write out all possible rolls that result in a total of $7$ , to get that there is a $\\frac{5}{72}$ chance that rolling three dice will result in a total of $7$ . Claim 1 : If all of Jason's initial outcomes are $4$ , $5$ or $6$ , Jason is best off rerolling everything. Proof of if part : If Jason rerolls two dice, he would like for the sum of the two outcomes to be $7-\\text{(The initial outcome of the untouched dice)}$ . Since in this case, every dice's initial outcome is $4$ , $5$ or $6$ , this value is $1$ , $2$ or $3$ . By basic dice probability, the probability that they add to one is $0$ ; the probability that they add to two is $\\frac{1}{36}$ ; the probability that they add to three is $\\frac{1}{18}$ . Each of these probabilities is less than $\\frac{5}{72}$ , (the probability of winning by rerolling everything) so Jason should not reroll one dice in this scenario. Rolling one die is also nonsense in this situation, since the other two dice will already add up to something greater than $7$ . Proof of only-if part : If Jason rolls a $1$ , $2$ or $3$ , even just once, then, the probability that rerolling the other two dice will result in win is $\\frac{5}{36}$ , $\\frac{1}{9}$ and $\\frac{1}{12}$ , by basic die probability. Each of these is greater than $\\frac{5}{72}$ , so if Jason rolls a $1$ , $2$ or $3$ , he should not reroll everything. Claim 2 : Iff the sum of any two of the initial dice is less than $7$ , Jason is best off rerolling one or zero die. Proof of if part : If the sum of any two of the initial dice is less than $7$ , when the other die is rolled, there is always a fixed $\\frac{1}{6}$ chance that this results in a win for Jason (or, he his initial roll already won, so he doesn't have to roll anything). Rerolling that one die is better than rerolling all three dice, since, as we have seen there is a $\\frac{5}{72}$ chance that Jason wins from that. Rerolling that one die is also better than rerolling two dice: by basic die probability, if Jason wishes for the sum of two rerolled dice to equal one value, the maximum probability this happens is $\\frac{1}{6}$ , and this is when he wishes for the sum to be $7$ ; however, since he wishes for the sum of all three dice to be $7$ , this will never happen, so the probability that rerolling two dice results in a win is always less than $\\frac{1}{6}$ . Proof of only-if part : If the sum of each pair of the three dice is at least $7$ , it would make no sense to reroll one die, since the final sum of all three dice will always be greater than $7$ . Also, if the sum of each pair of the three dice is at least $7$ , the total initial sum must also be greater than $7$ , so Jason should not reroll zero dice. From having shown these two claims, we know that Jason should reroll two dice if at least one of them is a $1$ , $2$ or $3$ , and if the sum of any two of the initial dice is at least $7$ . We can write out all the possibilities of initial rolls, account for their permutations, and add everything together to see that there are $42$ total outcomes, where Jason should reroll two dice. Therefore, our final answer is $\\frac{42}{216} = \\boxed{\\textbf{(A) } \\frac{7}{36}}$ . ~ ihatemath123 If the sum of the dice is 7, we reroll no dice.\n",
      "If the sum of any two dice is $\\leq 6$ , we reroll 1 die because rolling 1 die will give Jason a $\\frac{1}{6}$ chance of winning. \n",
      "Thus, we consider the scenario where the sum of any two dice is 7 or greater. If the smallest die is 1, the other two dice must be 6, which has $3$ possible permutations. If the smallest die is 2, the other two dice can be 5 or 6. There are 3 ways to choose the position of the smallest die, 2 ways each to choose the value of the other dice, so there are $2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 = 12$ possible permutations. If the smallest die is 3, the other two dice can be 4, 5, or 6. Similarly, there are 3 ways to choose the position of the smallest die, and 3 ways each to choose the value of the other dice, so there are $3 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 3 = 27$ possible permutations. If all die are 4 or above, then we reroll 3 dice. When we reroll all 3 dice, the winning rolls are 1,1,5; 1,2,4; 1,3,3; 2,2,3 in some arrangement, for a total of 15 permutations. Thus, the probability of winning after rerolling 3 dice is $\\frac{15}{6^3} = \\frac{5}{72}$ . If we reroll only 2 dice with the smallest die being $4$ , we would need to roll 1,2 or 2,1 to win, which gives a $\\frac{2}{36} = \\frac{4}{72}$ chance of winning, so this is worse. If the smallest die is 5 or 6, rerolling 2 dice gives us even worse odds. Therefore, the cases where 1, 2, or 3 are the smallest die covers all cases where 2 rerolls is optimal. There are $3+12+27 = 42$ permutations out of 216 total permutations, giving us a probability of $\\frac{42}{216} = \\boxed{\\frac{7}{36}}$ . ~JGsomeone, krwang https://youtu.be/B8pt8jF04ZM  https://artofproblemsolving.com/videos/amc/2020amc10a/516  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caUKXO7R0bc \n",

The ratio of $w$ to $y$ is then $\\frac{4}{\\frac{3}{4}}=\\frac{16}{3}$ so our answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E)}\\ 16:3}$ . ~quacker88 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqkNnsNEgiA (for AMC 10) https://youtu.be/Lz6XmHr8tJE (for AMC 12) ~Education, the Study of Everything  https://youtu.be/Gkm5rU5MlOU (for AMC 10) https://youtu.be/WfTty8Fe5Fo (for AMC 12)  https://youtu.be/y4BbRapJepY  ~savannahsolver https://youtu.be/wH7xhYxwaFc  ~AlexExplains\n",

      " Since the three angles of a triangle add up to $180^{\\circ}$ and one of the angles is $90^{\\circ}$ because it's a right triangle, $a^{\\circ} + b^{\\circ} = 90^{\\circ}$ . The greatest prime number less than $90$ is $89$ . If $a=89^{\\circ}$ , then $b=90^{\\circ}-89^{\\circ}=1^{\\circ}$ , which is not prime. The next greatest prime number less than $90$ is $83$ . If $a=83^{\\circ}$ , then $b=7^{\\circ}$ , which IS prime, so we have our answer $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D)}\\ 7}$ ~quacker88 Looking at the answer choices, only $7$ and $11$ are coprime to $90$ . Testing $7$ , the smaller angle, makes the other angle $83$ which is prime, therefore our answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D)}\\ 7}$  It is clear that $\\gcd(a,b)=1.$ By the Euclidean Algorithm, we have \\[\\gcd(a,b)=\\gcd(a+b,b)=\\gcd(90,b)=1,\\] so $90$ and $b$ are relatively prime. The least such prime number $b$ is $7,$ from which $a=90-b=83$ is also a prime number.

      " Solution 1 Rearranging the terms and and completing the square for $y$ yields the result $x^{2020}+(y-1)^2=1$ . Then, notice that $x$ can only be $0$ , $1$ and $-1$ because any value of $x^{2020}$ that is greater than 1 will cause the term $(y-1)^2$ to be less than $0$ , which is impossible as $y$ must be real. Therefore, plugging in the above values for $x$ gives the ordered pairs $(0,0)$ , $(1,1)$ , $(-1,1)$ , and $(0,2)$ gives  a  total  of $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) }4}$ ordered pairs. Solution 2 Bringing all of the terms to the LHS, we see a quadratic equation \\[y^2 - 2y + x^{2020} = 0\\] in terms of $y$ . Applying the quadratic formula, we get \\[y = \\frac{2\\pm\\sqrt{4-4\\cdot1\\cdot x^{2020}}}{2}=\\frac{2\\pm\\sqrt{4(1-x^{2020})}}{2}.\\] In order for $y$ to be real, which it must be given the stipulation that we are seeking integral answers, we know that the discriminant, $4(1-x^{2020})$ must be nonnegative. Therefore, \\[4(1-x^{2020}) \\geq 0 \\implies x^{2020} \\leq 1.\\] Here, we see that we must split the inequality into a compound, resulting in $-1 \\leq x \\leq 1$ . The only integers that satisfy this are $x \\in \\{-1,0,1\\}$ . Plugging these values back into the quadratic equation, we see that $x = \\{-1,1\\}$ both produce a discriminant of $0$ , meaning that there is only 1 solution for $y$ . If $x = \\{0\\}$ , then the discriminant is nonzero, therefore resulting in two solutions for $y$ . Thus, the answer is $2 \\cdot 1 + 1 \\cdot 2 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(D) }4}$ . ~Tiblis Solution 3: Solve for x first Set it up as a quadratic in terms of y: \\[y^2-2y+x^{2020}=0\\] Then the discriminant is \\[\\Delta = 4-4x^{2020}\\] This will clearly only yield real solutions when $|x^{2020}| \\leq 1$ , because the discriminant must be positive.\n",
      "Then $x=-1,0,1$ . Checking each one: $-1$ and $1$ are the same when raised to the 2020th power: \\[y^2-2y+1=(y-1)^2=0\\] This has only has solutions $1$ , so $(\\pm 1,1)$ are solutions.\n",
      "Next, if $x=0$ : \\[y^2-2y=0 \\Rightarrow y(y-2)=0\\] Which has 2 solutions, so $(0,2)$ and $(0,0)$ . These are the only 4 solutions, so our answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) } 4}$ . ~edits by BakedPotato66 Solution 4: Solve for y first Move the $y^2$ term to the other side to get $x^{2020}=2y-y^2 = y(2-y)$ . Because $x^{2020} \\geq 0$ for all $x$ , then $y(2-y) \\geq 0 \\Rightarrow y = 0,1,2$ . If $y=0$ or $y=2$ , the right side is $0$ and therefore $x=0$ . When $y=1$ , the right side become $1$ , therefore $x=1,-1$ . Our solutions are $(0,2)$ , $(0,0)$ , $(1,1)$ , $(-1,1)$ . These are the only $4$ solutions, so the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) } 4}$  - wwt7535 ~ edits by BakedPotato66 Solution 5: Similar to solution 4 Since $x^{2020}$ and $y^2$ are perfect squares, they are both nonnegative. That means $y^2$ plus a nonnegative number equals $2y$ , which means $y^2 \\leq 2y.$ The only possible integer values for $y$ are $0, 1, 2$ . For $y=0$ , $x$ can only be $0$ . For $y=1$ , $x^2=1$ so $x=1, -1$ . For $y=2$ , $x$ can only be $0$ as well. This gives us the solutions $(0, 0)$ , $(1, 1)$ , $(-1, 1)$ , and $(0, 2)$ . These are the only solutions, so there is a total of $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) } 4}$ ordered pairs. - kc1374 Solution 6: (Casework) We see that $x$ has to be $1$ , $0$ , or $-1$ , as any other integer would make this value too large. We also know that because $2020$ is even, both $-1$ , and $1$ for $x$ will yield the same $x^{2020}$ value of $1$ .  Case 1 : $x=0$ . This gives us that $y^2 = 2y$ . Dividing both sides by $y$ gives us $y = 2$ . Additionally, we know intuitively that $y = 0$ is also a case, which gives us 2 possibilities for this case.  Case 2 : $x = 1$ or $-1$ . This gives us that $1 + y^2 = 2y$ . Bringing the $2y$ to the other side, we have a simple quadratic. $y^2-2y + 1 = 0$ . Factor to get $(y-1)^2 = 0$ so $y = 1$ . Because this works for $x$ as $-1$ and $1$ , there are 2 possibilities for this case.  Adding the cases gets us our final answer of $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) } 4}$ ordered pairs.\n",
      "~iluvme Solution 7: (Casework)  We can move the $y^2$ term to the other side to obtain $x^{2020} = 2y - y^2$ , which can be easily factored into $x^{2020} = (2-y)y$ . If we raise each side to the power 1/2020, we get $x = ((2-y)(y))^{1/2020}$ . Since we're dealing with integer values, the inside of the square root and thus $(2-y)y$ must be greater than $0$ . For this to happen, $y$ must be between $0$ and $2$ inclusive. Testing each integer value, we get the cases: $\\textbf{Case 1}$ : When $y=0$ , then $y(2-y)$ is also 0, and since the square root of $0$ is $0$ , $x$ must also be $0$ . So our first pair of solutions is $(0,0)$ . $\\textbf{Case 2}$ : When $y=1$ , then $y(2-y)$ is also 1. The possible values for $x$ are $1$ and $-1$ , so we get 2 more pairs of solutions: $(1, -1)$ and $(1,1)$ . $\\textbf{Case 3}$ : When $y=2$ , then $y(2-y)$ is $0$ , and since the square root of $0$ is $0$ , $x$ must also be $0$ - so we get one more pair of solutions, $(2,0)$  If we count all these pairs( $(0,0),(1,-1),(1,1),(2,0)$ ), we have 4 pairs of solutions, so our answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) } 4}$ ordered pairs. - youtube.com/indianmathguy  Video Solution (HOW TO CREATIVELY PROBLEM SOLVE!!!)  https://youtu.be/FfATkdxncG4  ~Education, the Study of Everything  Video Solution 1 by TheBeautyOfMath  https://youtu.be/6ujfjGLzVoE   Video Solution by WhyMath  https://youtu.be/7dQ423hhgac  ~savannahsolver  Video Solution by Sohil Rathi  https://youtu.be/zfChnbMGLVQ?t=4251   See Also    2020 AMC 10B ( Problems • Answer Key • Resources )   Preceded by Problem 8   Followed by Problem 10    1  •  2  •  3  •  4  •  5  •  6  •  7  •  8  •  9  •  10  •  11  •  12  •  13  •  14  •  15  •  16  •  17  •  18  •  19  •  20  •  21  •  22  •  23  •  24  •  25    All AMC 10 Problems and Solutions     2020 AMC 12B ( Problems • Answer Key • Resources )   Preceded by Problem 7   Followed by Problem 9    1  •  2  •  3  •  4  •  5  •  6  •  7  •  8  •  9  •  10  •  11  •  12  •  13  •  14  •  15  •  16  •  17  •  18  •  19  •  20  •  21  •  22  •  23  •  24  •  25    All AMC 12 Problems and Solutions   The problems on this page are copyrighted by the Mathematical Association of America 's American Mathematics Competitions .

      " Solution 1 Notice that when the cone is created, the 2 shown radii when merged will become the slant height of the cone and the intact circumference of the circle will become the circumference of the base of the cone. We can calculate that the intact circumference of the circle is $8\\pi\\cdot\\frac{3}{4}=6\\pi$ . Since that is also equal to the circumference of the cone, the radius of the cone is $3$ .

Note that there cannot be $2$ diameters since there would be one person on either side that will not have a pair adjacent to them.

No matter what the $k-th$ step involves $k+1$ numbers to choose from. The numerators are the number of successful operations. No matter the order, the first time a red is added will come from 1 choice and the second time will come from 2 choices, since that is how many reds are in the urn originally.\n",

On George's first move, he either chooses the red or the blue with a $\\frac{1}{2}$ chance each. We can assume he chooses Red(chance $\\frac{1}{2}$ ), and then multiply the final answer by two for symmetry. Now, there are two red balls and one blue ball in the urn.

Since this is equal to the probability there are more blue balls, the probability there are equal amounts is $1-2P(R)$ . $P(R) =$ the probability no more blues are chosen plus the probability only 1 more blue is chosen. The first case, $P(\\text{no more blues}) = \\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\frac{2}{3}\\cdot\\frac{3}{4}\\cdot\\frac{4}{5}=\\frac{1}{5}$ .

      "Notice that there are only two ways that we can end up with $i$ red balls and $j$ blue balls: one is by fetching a red ball from the urn when we have $i - 1$ red balls and $j$ blue balls and the other is by fetching a blue ball from the urn when we have $i$ red balls and $j - 1$ blue balls. Then we have $dp[i][j] = \\frac{i - 1}{i - 1 + j} dp[i - 1][j] + \\frac{j - 1}{i - 1 + j} dp[i][j - 1]$  Then we start can with $dp[1][1] = 1$ and try to compute $dp[3][3]$ . \\[\\begin{array}{|c || c | c | c | c | c |} \\hline i \\text{\\ \\textbackslash\\ } j & 1 & 2 & 3\\\\ \\hline\\hline 1 & 1 & 1/2 & 1/3\\\\ \\hline 2 & 1/2 & 1/3 & 1/4\\\\ \\hline 3 & 1/3 & 1/4 & 1/5\\\\ \\hline \\end{array}\\] The answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B)}\\ \\frac{1}{5}}$ . (Solution by CircleOO) Basically, George is picking a ball and adding another ball of that color to the urn. Basically, he needs to pick a red ball twice and a blue ball twice to get 3 red and 3 blue balls in the urn. The number of ways to choose a red ball twice is $1\\cdot 2$ (at the start there's 1 red ball, then he needs to choose it again when there's 2, and then there is 3 red balls so he doesn't need to choose it again). Similarly the number of ways to choose blue balls twice is 2. $2\\cdot 2$ = 4 ways to choose 2 red balls and 2 blue balls (not considering order). The total number of ways is $2\\cdot 3\\cdot 4\\cdot 5$ . Adding order to the 4 ways to choose 2 red and 2 blue balls, it is 4C2 because out of the 4 ball choosings, 2 of them must be red, and we automatically make the other ones blue. $\\frac{\\binom42 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2}{2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 5} = \\frac{1}{5}$ . https://youtu.be/4lTIWhNAvYk  ~Education, the Study of Everything https://youtu.be/3BvJeZU3T-M \n",

      " Let $P(x) = x^5+ax^4+bx^3+cx^2+dx+2020$ . We first notice that $\\frac{-1+i\\sqrt{3}}{2} = e^{2\\pi i / 3}$ .  That is because of Euler's Formula : $e^{ix} = \\cos(x) + i \\cdot \\sin(x)$ . $\\frac{-1+i\\sqrt{3}}{2}$ = $-\\frac{1}{2} + i \\cdot \\frac {\\sqrt{3}}{2}$ = $\\cos(120^\\circ) + i \\cdot \\sin(120^\\circ) = e^{ 2\\pi i / 3}$ . In order $r$ to be a root of $P$ , $re^{2\\pi i / 3}$ must also be a root of P, meaning that 3 of the roots of $P$ must be $r$ , $re^{i\\frac{2\\pi}{3}}$ , $re^{i\\frac{4\\pi}{3}}$ . However, since $P$ is degree 5, there must be two additional roots. Let one of these roots be $w$ , if $w$ is a root, then $we^{2\\pi i / 3}$ and $we^{4\\pi i / 3}$ must also be roots. However, $P$ is a fifth degree polynomial, and can therefore only have $5$ roots. This implies that $w$ is either $r$ , $re^{2\\pi i / 3}$ , or $re^{4\\pi i / 3}$ . Thus we know that the polynomial $P$ can be written in the form $(x-r)^m(x-re^{2\\pi i / 3})^n(x-re^{4\\pi i / 3})^p$ . Moreover, by Vieta's, we know that there is only one possible value for the magnitude of $r$ as $||r||^5 = 2020$ , meaning that the amount of possible polynomials $P$ is equivalent to the possible sets $(m,n,p)$ . In order for the coefficients of the polynomial to all be real, $n = p$ due to $re^{2\\pi i / 3}$ and $re^{4 \\pi i / 3}$ being conjugates and since $m+n+p = 5$ , (as the polynomial is 5th degree) we have two possible solutions for $(m, n, p)$ which are $(1,2,2)$ and $(3,1,1)$ yielding two possible polynomials. The answer is thus $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) } 2}$ . ~Murtagh Let $x_1=r$ , then \\[x_2=\\frac{-1+i\\sqrt{3}}{2} r,\\]  \\[x_3=\\left( \\frac{-1+i\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\right) ^2 r =\\left( \\frac{-1-i\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\right) r,\\]  \\[x_4=\\left( \\frac{-1+i\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\right) ^3 r=r,\\] which means $x_4$ is the same as $x_1$ . Now we have 3 different roots of the polynomial, $x_1$ , $x_2$ , and $x_3$ . Next, we will prove that all 5 roots of the polynomial must be chosen from those 3 roots. Let us assume that there is one root $x_4=p$ which is different from the three roots we already know, then there must be two other roots, \\[x_5=\\left( \\frac{-1+i\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\right) ^2 p =\\left( \\frac{-1-i\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\right) p,\\]  \\[x_6=\\left( \\frac{-1+i\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\right) ^3 p=p,\\] different from all known roots. We get 6 different roots for the polynomial, which contradicts the limit of 5 roots. Therefore the assumption of a different root is wrong, thus the roots must be chosen from $x_1$ , $x_2$ , and $x_3$ . The polynomial then can be written like $f(x)=(x-x_1)^m (x-x_2)^n (x-x_3)^q$ , where $m$ , $n$ , and $q$ are non-negative integers and $m+n+q=5$ . Since $a$ , $b$ , $c$ and $d$ are real numbers, then $n$ must be equal to $q$ . Therefore $(m,n,q)$ can only be $(1,2,2)$ or $(3,1,1)$ , so the answer is $\\boxed{\\mathbf{(C)} 2}$ . ~Yelong_Li https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8V5l5jeQjNg \n",

Let the point of intersection be $K$ . We note that $EBK$ is also a right isosceles triangle with side $2-\\sqrt{2}$ and find its area to be $3-2\\sqrt{2}$ .

      "Let $1,2,3,$ and $4$ denote which quadrant $A$ is in. Realize that from any odd quadrant and any orientation, the $4$ transformations result in some permutation of $(2+, 2-, 4+, 4-).$  The same goes that from any even quadrant and any orientation, the $4$ transformations result in some permutation of $(1+, 1-, 3+, 3-).$  We start our first $19$ moves by doing whatever we want, $4$ choices each time. Since $19$ is odd, we must end up on an even quadrant. As said above, we know that exactly one of the four transformations will give us $(1+),$ and we must use that transformation. Thus, the answer is $4^{19}=\\boxed{\\textbf{(C)}\\ 2^{38}}.$  Notice that any pair of transformations either swaps the $x$ and $y$ -coordinates, negates the $x$ and $y$ -coordinates, swaps and negates the $x$ and $y$ -coordinates, or leaves the original unchanged. Furthermore, notice that for each of these results, if we apply another pair of transformations, one of these results will happen again, and with equal probability. Therefore, no matter what state we are in after we apply the first $9$ pairs of transformations, there is a $\\frac{1}{4}$ chance the last pair of transformations will return the figure to its original position. Therefore, the answer is $\\frac{4^{20}}{4} = 4^{19} = \\boxed{\\textbf{(C)}\\ 2^{38}}.$  The total number of sequences is $4^{20}=2^{40}.$  Note that there can only be an even number of reflections since they result in the same anti-clockwise orientation of the vertices $A,B,C,D.$ Therefore, the probability of having the same anti-clockwise orientation with the original arrangement after the transformation is $\\frac{1}{2}.$  Next, the even number of reflections means that there must be an even number of rotations since their sum is even. Even rotations result in only the original position or a $180^{\\circ}$ rotation of it. Since rotation $R$ and rotation $L$ cancel each other out, the difference between the numbers of them define the final position. The probability of the transformation returning the vertices to the original position, given that there are even number of rotations, is equivalent to the probability that $|n(R)-n(L)|\\equiv0\\pmod{4}$ when $|n(H)-n(V)|\\equiv0\\pmod{4}$ or $|n(R)-n(L)|\\equiv2\\pmod{4}$ when $|n(H)-n(V)|\\equiv2\\pmod{4}$ which is again, $\\frac{1}{2}.$  Therefore, the answer is $2^{40}\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}=\\boxed{\\textbf{(C)}\\ 2^{38}}.$  ~joshuamh111 ~Edits by Eric X This problem is a Dihedral Group problem, $D_4$ , in Group Theory .

Suppose we choose $R \\circ V$ , then \\[V \\circ (H \\circ R) \\circ R = V \\circ (R \\circ V) \\circ R = V \\circ R \\circ (V \\circ R).\\] From $(4)$ , $V \\circ R = L \\circ V = H \\circ L = R \\circ H$ , so $V \\circ R$ can be replaced with $L \\circ V$ , $H \\circ L$ , $R \\circ H$ without changing the result. Suppose we choose $H \\circ L$ , then \\[V \\circ R \\circ (V \\circ R) =V \\circ R \\circ (H \\circ L) = V \\circ R \\circ H \\circ L = I.\\] So, we have $f(4) = 4^{4-1}$ : \\[\\underbrace{R \\circ R \\circ R \\circ R \\circ \\dots R \\circ R \\circ R}_{2n}.\\] With $2n$  $R$ transformations, it will go from initial state to initial state. There are $2n-1$ transformation composite operators $\\circ$ between the transformations, and each pair of transformations surrounding the transformations composite operator $\\circ$ have $4$ options. So, we have $f(2n) = 4^{2n-1}$ , from which $f(20) = 4^{20-1} = \\boxed{\\textbf{(C)}\\ 2^{38}}$ . Side Note  Equations $(2)$ , $(3)$ , $(4)$ are equivalent.

Case 4: Black-white color distribution is 3-3 By simple intuition, there are also two $classes$ for this case, the $class$ where the three red faces meet at a single vertex, and the other class where the three red faces are in a \"straight line\" along the edges of the cube. Note that since there are $8$ vertices in a cube, there are $8$ members of the former class and $\\dbinom{6}{3} - 8 = 12$ members of the latter class. Thus, $12^2 + 8^2$ ways to paint the cubes for this case. Note that by symmetry (since we are only switching the colors), the number of ways to paint the cubes for black-white color distributions 4-2, 5-1, and 6-0 is 2-4, 1-5, and 0-6 (respectively). Thus, our total answer is \\[\\frac{2(6^2 + 1^2 + 12^2 + 3^2) + 12^2 + 8^2}{2^{12}} = \\frac{588}{4096} = \\boxed{\\textbf{(D) } \\frac{147}{1024}}.\\]  -fidgetboss_4000 https://youtu.be/n9zwaCZnDPg  ~Education, the Study of Everything    https://youtu.be/V5qI12icrm8 \n",

      " We can first consider the equation without a floor function: \\[\\dfrac{n+1000}{70} = \\sqrt{n}\\]  Multiplying both sides by 70 and then squaring: \\[n^2 + 2000n + 1000000 = 4900n\\]  Moving all terms to the left: \\[n^2 - 2900n + 1000000 = 0\\]  Now we can determine the factors: \\[(n-400)(n-2500) = 0\\]  This means that for $n = 400$ and $n = 2500$ , the equation will hold without the floor function. Now we can simply check the multiples of 70 around 400 and 2500 in the original equation, which we abbreviate as $L=R$ . For $n = 330$ , $L=19$ but $18^2 < 330 < 19^2$ so $R=18$  For $n = 400$ , $L=20$ and $R=20$  For $n = 470$ , $L=21$ , $R=21$  For $n = 540$ , $L=22$ but $540 > 23^2$ so $R=23$  Now we move to $n = 2500$  For $n = 2430$ , $L=49$ and $49^2 < 2430 < 50^2$ so $R=49$  For $n = 2360$ , $L=48$ and $48^2 < 2360 < 49^2$ so $R=48$  For $n = 2290$ , $L=47$ and $47^2 < 2360 < 48^2$ so $R=47$  For $n = 2220$ , $L=46$ but $47^2 < 2220$ so $R=47$  For $n = 2500$ , $L=50$ and $R=50$  For $n = 2570$ , $L=51$ but $2570 < 51^2$ so $R=50$  Therefore we have 6 total solutions, $n = 400, 470, 2290, 2360, 2430, 2500 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(C) 6}}$  This is my first solution here, so please forgive me for any errors. We are given that \\[\\frac{n+1000}{70}=\\lfloor\\sqrt{n}\\rfloor\\]  $\\lfloor\\sqrt{n}\\rfloor$ must be an integer, which means that $n+1000$ is divisible by $70$ . As $1000\\equiv 20\\pmod{70}$ , this means that $n\\equiv 50\\pmod{70}$ , so we can write $n=70k+50$ for $k\\in\\mathbb{Z}$ . Therefore, \\[\\frac{n+1000}{70}=\\frac{70k+1050}{70}=k+15=\\lfloor\\sqrt{70k+50}\\rfloor\\]  Also, we can say that $\\sqrt{70k+50}-1 < k+15$ and $k+15\\leq\\sqrt{70k+50}$  Squaring the second inequality, we get $k^{2}+30k+225\\leq70k+50\\implies k^{2}-40k+175\\leq 0\\implies (k-5)(k-35)\\leq0\\implies 5\\leq k\\leq 35$ . Similarly solving the first inequality gives us $k < 19-\\sqrt{155}$ or $k > 19+\\sqrt{155}$  $\\sqrt{155}$ is larger than $12$ and smaller than $13$ , so instead, we can say $k\\leq 6$ or $k\\geq 32$ . Combining this with $5\\leq k\\leq 35$ , we get $k=5,6,32,33,34,35$ are all solutions for $k$ that give a valid solution for $n$ , meaning that our answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) 6}}$ .\n",
      "-Solution By Qqqwerw We start with the given equation \\[\\dfrac{n+1000}{70} = \\lfloor \\sqrt{n} \\rfloor\\] From there, we can start with the general inequality that $\\lfloor \\sqrt{n} \\rfloor \\leq \\sqrt{n} < \\lfloor \\sqrt{n} \\rfloor + 1$ . This means that \\[\\dfrac{n+1000}{70} \\leq \\sqrt{n} < \\dfrac{n+1070}{70}\\] Solving each inequality separately gives us two inequalities: \\[n - 70\\sqrt{n} +1000 \\leq 0 \\rightarrow (\\sqrt{n}-50)(\\sqrt{n}-20)\\leq 0 \\rightarrow 20\\leq \\sqrt{n} \\leq 50\\] \\[n-70\\sqrt{n}+1070 > 0 \\rightarrow \\sqrt{n} < 35-\\sqrt{155} , \\sqrt{n} > 35+\\sqrt{155}\\] Simplifying and approximating decimals yields 2 solutions for one inequality and 4 for the other. Hence, the answer is $2+4 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(C) } 6}$ . ~Rekt4 Let $n$ be uniquely of the form $n=k^2+r$ where $0 \\le r \\le 2k \\; \\bigstar$ . Then, \\[\\frac{k^2+r+1000}{70} = k\\] Rearranging and completeing the square gives \\[(k-35)^2 + r = 225\\]  \\[\\Rightarrow r = (k-20)(50-k)\\; \\smiley\\] This gives us \\[(k-35)^2 \\le (k-35)^2+r=225 \\le (k-35)^2 + 2k\\] Solving the left inequality shows that $20 \\le k \\le 50$ . Combing this with the right inequality gives that \\[(k-35)^2+r=225 \\le (k-35)^2 + 2k \\le (k-35)^2+100\\] which implies either $k \\ge 47$ or $k \\le 23$ . By directly computing the cases for $k = 20, 21, 22, 23, 47, 48, 49, 50$ using $\\smiley$ , it follows that only $k = 22, 23$ yield and invalid $r$ from $\\bigstar$ . Since each $k$ corresponds to one $r$ and thus to one $n$ (from $\\smiley$ and the original form), there must be 6 such $n$ . ~the_jake314 Since the right-hand-side is an integer, so must be the left-hand-side. Therefore, we must have $n\\equiv -20\\pmod{70}$ ; let $n=70j-20$ . The given equation becomes \\[j+14 = \\lfloor \\sqrt{70j-20} \\rfloor\\]  Since $\\lfloor x \\rfloor \\leq x < \\lfloor x \\rfloor +1$ for all real $x$ , we can take $x=\\sqrt{70j-20}$ with $\\lfloor x \\rfloor =j+14$ to get \\[j+14 \\leq \\sqrt{70j-20} < j+15\\] We can square the inequality to get \\[196+28j+j^{2} \\leq 70j-20 < 225 + 30j + j^{2}\\] The left inequality simplifies to $(j-36)(j-6) \\leq 0$ , which yields \\[6 \\le j \\le 36.\\] The right inequality simplifies to $(j-20)^2 - 155 > 0$ , which yields \\[j < 20 - \\sqrt{155} < 8 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad j > 20 + \\sqrt{155} > 32\\]  Solving $j < 8$ , and $6 \\le j \\le 36$ , we get $6 \\le j < 8$ , for $2$ values $j\\in \\{6, 7\\}$ . Solving $j >32$ , and $6 \\le j \\le 36$ , we get $32 < j \\le 36$ , for $4$ values $k\\in \\{33, \\ldots , 36\\}$ . Thus, our answer is $2 + 4 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }6}$  ~KingRavi Set $x=\\sqrt{n}$ in the given equation and solve for $x$ to get $x^2 = 70 \\cdot \\lfloor x \\rfloor - 1000$ . Set $k = \\lfloor x \\rfloor \\ge 0$ ; since $\\lfloor x \\rfloor^2 \\le x^2 < (\\lfloor x \\rfloor + 1)^2$ , we get \\[k^2 \\le  70k - 1000 < k^2 + 2k + 1.\\] The left inequality simplifies to $(k-20)(k-50) \\le 0$ , which yields \\[20 \\le k \\le 50.\\] The right inequality simplifies to $(k-34)^2 > 155$ , which yields \\[k < 34 - \\sqrt{155} < 22 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad k > 34 + \\sqrt{155} > 46\\] Solving $k < 22$ , and $20 \\le k \\le 50$ , we get $20 \\le k < 22$ , for $2$ values $k\\in \\{20, 21\\}$ . Solving $k >46$ , and $20 \\le k \\le 50$ , we get $46 < k \\le 50$ , for $4$ values $k\\in \\{47, \\ldots , 50\\}$ . Thus, our answer is $2 + 4 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }6}$  ~ isabelchen  If $n$ is a perfect square, we can write $n = k^2$ for a positive integer $k$ , so $\\lfloor \\sqrt{n} \\rfloor = \\sqrt{n} = k.$ The given equation turns into k 2 + 1000 70 = k k 2 − 70 k + 1000 = 0 ( k − 20 ) ( k − 50 ) = 0 ,  so $k = 20$ or $k= 50$ , so $n = 400, 2500.$  If $n$ is not square, then we can say that, for a positive integer $k$ , we have k 2 < n < ( k + 1 ) 2 k 2 + 1000 < n + 1000 = 70 ⌊ n ⌋ = 70 k < ( k + 1 ) 2 + 1000 k 2 + 1000 < 70 k < ( k + 1 ) 2 + 1000.  To solve this inequality, we take the intersection of the two solution sets to each of the two inequalities $k^2 + 1000 < 70k$ and $70k < (k+1)^2 + 1000$ . To solve the first one, we have k 2 − 70 k + 1000 < 0 ( k − 20 ) ( k − 50 ) < 0  $k\\in (20, 50),$ because the portion of the parabola between its two roots will be negative. The second inequality yields 70 k < k 2 + 2 k + 1 + 1000 0 < k 2 − 68 k + 1001. This time, the inequality will hold for all portions of the parabola that are not on or between the its two roots, which are $34 + \\sqrt{155}>46$ and $34-\\sqrt{155}<22$ (they are roughly equal, but this is to ensure that we do not miss any solutions). Notation wise, we need all integers $k$ such that \\[k \\in \\left(20, 50\\right) \\cap \\left(-\\infty,34 - \\sqrt{155} \\right)\\] or \\[k \\in \\left(20, 50\\right) \\cap \\left(34 + \\sqrt{155}, \\infty \\right).\\]  For the first one, since our uppoer bound is a little less than $22$ , the $k$ that works is $21$ . For the second, our lower bound is a little more than $46$ , so the $k$ that work are $47, 48,$ and $49$ . $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C) }6}$ total solutions for $n$ , since each value of $k$ corresponds to exactly one value of $n$ . -Benedict T (countmath1) Video Solution 1 On The Spot STEM: https://youtu.be/BEJybl9TLMA  Video Solution 2 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWeioXzQxVA&list=PLLCzevlMcsWNcTZEaxHe8VaccrhubDOlQ&index=9 ~ MathEx Video Solution 3 by the Beauty of Math https://youtu.be/4RVYoeiyC4w?t=62 \n",

      " We proceed by using AM-GM. We get $\\frac{(2^t-3t) + 3t}{2}$  $\\ge \\sqrt{(2^t-3t)(3t)}$ . Thus, squaring gives us that $4^{t-1} \\ge (2^t-3t)(3t)$ . Remembering what we want to find, we divide both sides of the inequality by the positive amount of $\\frac{1}{3\\cdot4^t}$ . We get the maximal values as $\\frac{1}{12}$ , and we are done. Set $u = t2^{-t}$ . Then the expression in the problem can be written as \\[R = - 3t^24^{-t} + t2^{-t}= - 3u^2 + u = - 3 (u - 1/6)^2 + \\frac{1}{12} \\le \\frac{1}{12} .\\] It is easy to see that $u =\\frac{1}{6}$ is attained for some value of $t$ between $t = 0$ and $t = 1$ , thus the maximal value of $R$ is $\\textbf{(C)}\\ \\frac{1}{12}$ . We want to maximize $f(t) = \\frac{(2^t-3t)t}{4^t} = \\frac{t\\cdot 2^t-3t^2}{4^t}$ . We can use the first derivative test. Use quotient rule to get the following: \\[\\frac{(2^t + t\\cdot \\ln{2} \\cdot 2^t - 6t)4^t - (t\\cdot 2^t - 3t^2)4^t \\cdot 2\\ln{2}}{(4^t)^2} = 0 \\implies 2^t + t\\cdot \\ln{2} \\cdot 2^t - 6t = (t\\cdot 2^t - 3t^2) 2\\ln{2}\\]  \\[\\implies 2^t + t\\cdot \\ln{2}\\cdot 2^t - 6t = 2t\\ln{2} \\cdot 2^t - 6t^2 \\ln{2}\\]  \\[\\implies 2^t(1-t\\cdot \\ln{2}) = 6t(1 - t\\cdot \\ln{2}) \\implies 2^t = 6t\\] Therefore, we plug this back into the original equation to get $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C)} \\frac{1}{12}}$  ~awesome1st First, substitute $2^t = x (\\log_2{x} = t)$ so that \\[\\frac{(2^t-3t)t}{4^t} = \\frac{x\\log_2{x}-3(\\log_2{x})^2}{x^2}\\]  Notice that \\[\\frac{x\\log_2{x}-3(\\log_2{x})^2}{x^2} = \\frac{\\log_2{x}}{x}-3\\Big(\\frac{\\log_2{x}}{x}\\Big)^2.\\]  When seen as a function, $\\frac{\\log_2{x}}{x}-3\\Big(\\frac{\\log_2{x}}{x}\\Big)^2$ is a synthesis function that has $\\frac{\\log_2{x}}{x}$ as its inner function. If we substitute $\\frac{\\log_2{x}}{x} = p$ , the given function becomes a quadratic function that has a maximum value of $\\frac{1}{12}$ when $p = \\frac{1}{6}$ . Now we need to check if $\\frac{\\log_2{x}}{x}$ can have the value of $\\frac{1}{6}$ in the range of real numbers. In the range of (positive) real numbers, function $\\frac{\\log_2{x}}{x}$ is a continuous function whose value gets infinitely smaller as $x$ gets closer to 0 (as $log_2{x}$ also diverges toward negative infinity in the same condition). When $x = 2$ , $\\frac{\\log_2{x}}{x} = \\frac{1}{2}$ , which is larger than $\\frac{1}{6}$ . Therefore, we can assume that $\\frac{\\log_2{x}}{x}$ equals to $\\frac{1}{6}$ when $x$ is somewhere between 1 and 2 (at least), which means that the maximum value of $\\frac{(2^t-3t)t}{4^t}$ is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C)}\\ \\frac{1}{12}}$ . Let the maximum value of the function be $m$ . Then we have \\[\\frac{(2^t-3t)t}{4^t} = m \\implies m2^{2t} - t2^t + 3t^2 = 0.\\] Solving for $2^{t}$ , we see \\[2^{t} = \\frac{t}{2m} \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{t^2 - 12mt^2}}{2m} = \\frac{t}{2m} \\pm \\frac{t\\sqrt{1 - 12m}}{2m}.\\] We see that $1 - 12m \\geq 0 \\implies m \\leq \\frac{1}{12}.$ Therefore, the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(C)}\\ \\frac{1}{12}}$ . Let $z=2^t.$ Then, \\[\\frac{\\left(2^t-3t\\right)t}{4^t}=\\frac{\\left(z-3t\\right)t}{z^2} = \\frac{-3t^2+zt}{z^2}.\\]  Upon inspection, the numerator of this expression grows at a relatively faster rate than the denominator, when $t$ is close to $0$ . As the numerator is a quadratic in $t$ with a negative leading coefficient, its maximum value occurs at $t=\\frac{-z}{2\\cdot -3}=\\frac{z}{6},$ or when $6t=2^t.$ Therefore, \\[\\frac{\\left(2^t-3t\\right)t}{4^t}=\\frac{\\left(6t-3t\\right)t}{(6t)^2}=\\frac{3t^2}{36t^2}=\\boxed{\\textbf{(C)}\\ \\frac{1}{12}}.\\]  -Benedict T (countmath1) https://youtu.be/c2_b18Lv7c4  ~Education, the Study of Everything Problem starts at 2:10 in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HRSzpdJaX0&t=130s  -MistyMathMusic\n",

      " For $n=2$ , we see that if $z_{1}+z_{2}=0$ , then $z_{1}=-z_{2}$ , so they are evenly spaced along the unit circle. For $n=3$ , WLOG, we can set $z_{1}=1$ . Notice that now Re $(z_{2}+z_{3})=-1$ and Im $\\{z_{2}\\}$ = $-$ Im $\\{z_{3}\\}$ . This forces $z_{2}$ and $z_{3}$ to be equal to $e^{i\\frac{2\\pi}{3}}$ and $e^{-i\\frac{2\\pi}{3}}$ , meaning that all three are equally spaced along the unit circle.

      " Note that $96 = 2^5 \\cdot 3$ . Since there are at most six not necessarily distinct factors $>1$ multiplying to $96$ , we have six cases: $k=1, 2, ..., 6.$ Now we look at each of the six cases.  $k=1$ : We see that there is $1$ way, merely $96$ . $k=2$ : This way, we have the $3$ in one slot and $2$ in another, and symmetry. The four other $2$ 's leave us with $5$ ways and symmetry doubles us so we have $10$ . $k=3$ : We have $3, 2, 2$ as our baseline. We need to multiply by $2$ in $3$ places, and see that we can split the remaining three powers of $2$ in a manner that is $3-0-0$ , $2-1-0$ or $1-1-1$ . A $3-0-0$ split has $6 + 3 = 9$ ways of happening ( $24-2-2$ and symmetry; $2-3-16$ and symmetry), a $2-1-0$ split has $6 \\cdot 3 = 18$ ways of happening (due to all being distinct) and a $1-1-1$ split has $3$ ways of happening ( $6-4-4$ and symmetry) so in this case we have $9+18+3=30$ ways. $k=4$ : We have $3, 2, 2, 2$ as our baseline, and for the two other $2$ 's, we have a $2-0-0-0$ or $1-1-0-0$ split. The former grants us $4+12=16$ ways ( $12-2-2-2$ and symmetry and $3-8-2-2$ and symmetry) and the latter grants us also $12+12=24$ ways ( $6-4-2-2$ and symmetry and $3-4-4-2$ and symmetry) for a total of $16+24=40$ ways. $k=5$ : We have $3, 2, 2, 2, 2$ as our baseline and one place to put the last two: on another two or on the three. On the three gives us $5$ ways due to symmetry and on another two gives us $5 \\cdot 4 = 20$ ways due to symmetry. Thus, we have $5+20=25$ ways. $k=6$ : We have $3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2$ and symmetry and no more twos to multiply, so by symmetry, we have $6$ ways. Thus, adding, we have $1+10+30+40+25+6=\\boxed{\\textbf{(A) } 112}$ . ~kevinmathz As before, note that $96=2^5\\cdot3$ , and we need to consider 6 different cases, one for each possible value of $k$ , the number of factors in our factorization. However, instead of looking at each individually, find a general form for the number of possible factorizations with $k$ factors. First, the factorization needs to contain one factor that is itself a multiple of $3$ . There are $k$ to choose from. That leaves $k-1$ slots left to fill, each of which must contain at least one factor of $2$ . Once we have filled in a $2$ to each of the remaining slots, we're left with $5-(k-1)=6-k$ twos. Consider the remaining $6-k$ factors of $2$ left to assign to the $k$ factors. Using stars and bars, the number of ways to do this is: \\[{{(6-k)+k-1}\\choose{6-k}}={5\\choose{6-k}}\\] This makes $k{5\\choose{6-k}}$ possibilities for each k. To obtain the total number of factorizations, add all possible values for k: \\[\\sum_{k=1}^6 k{5\\choose{6-k}}=1+10+30+40+25+6=\\boxed{\\textbf{(A) } \\text{112}}.\\]  ~Continuous_Pi Begin by examining $f_1$ . $f_1$ can take on any value that is a factor of $96$ except $1$ . For each choice of $f_1$ , the resulting $f_2...f_k$ must have a product of $96/f_1$ . This means the number of ways the rest $f_a$ , $1<a<=k$ can be written by the scheme stated in the problem for each $f_1$ is equal to $D(96/f_1)$ , since the product of $f_2 \\cdot f_3... \\cdot f_k=x$ is counted as one valid product if and only if $f_1 \\cdot x=96$ , the product $x$ has the properties that factors are greater than $1$ , and differently ordered products are counted separately. For example, say the first factor is $2$ . Then, the remaining numbers must multiply to $48$ , so the number of ways the product can be written beginning with $2$ is $D(48)$ . To add up all the number of solutions for every possible starting factor, $D(96/f_1)$ must be calculated and summed for all possible $f_1$ , except $96$ and $1$ , since a single $1$ is not counted according to the problem statement. The $96$ however, is counted, but only results in $1$ possibility, the first and only factor being $96$ . This means $D(96)=D(48)+D(32)+D(24)+D(16)+D(12)+D(8)+D(6)+D(4)+D(3)+D(2)+1$ . Instead of calculating D for the larger factors first, reduce $D(48)$ , $D(32)$ , and $D(24)$ into sums of $D(m)$ where $m<=16$ to ease calculation. Following the recursive definition $D(n)=($ sums of $D(c))+1$ where c takes on every divisor of n except for 1 and itself, the sum simplifies to $D(96)=(D(24)+D(16)+D(12)+D(8)+D(6)+D(4)+D(3)+D(2)+1)$ + $(D(16)+D(8)+D(4)+D(2)+1)+D(24)+D(16)+D(12)+D(8)+D(6)+D(4)+D(3)+D(2)+1.$  $D(24)=D(12)+D(8)+D(6)+D(4)+D(3)+D(2)+1$ , so the sum further simplifies to $D(96)=3D(16)+4D(12)+5D(8)+4D(6)+5D(4)+4D(3)+5D(2)+5$ , after combining terms. From quick casework, $D(16)=8, D(12)=8, D(8)=4, D(6)=3, D(4)=2, D(3)=1$ and $D(2)=1$ . Substituting these values into the expression above, $D(96)=3 \\cdot 8+4 \\cdot 8+5 \\cdot 4+4 \\cdot 3+5 \\cdot 2+4 \\cdot 1+5 \\cdot 1+5=\\boxed{\\textbf{(A) } 112}$ . ~monmath a.k.a Fmirza Note that $96 = 3 \\cdot 2^5$ , and that $D$ of a perfect power of a prime is relatively easy to calculate. Also note that you can find $D(96)$ from $D(32)$ by simply totaling the number of ways there are to insert a $3$ into a set of numbers that multiply to $32$ . First, calculate $D(32)$ . Since $32 = 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2$ , all you have to do was find the number of ways to divide the $2$ 's into groups, such that each group has at least one $2$ . By stars and bars, this results in $1$ way with five terms, $4$ ways with four terms, $6$ ways with three terms, $4$ ways with two terms, and $1$ way with one term. (The total, $16$ , is not needed for the remaining calculations.) Then, to get $D(96)$ , in each possible $D(32)$ sequence, insert a $3$ somewhere in it, either by placing it somewhere next to the original numbers (in one of $n+1$ ways, where $n$ is the number of terms in the $D(32)$ sequence), or by multiplying one of the numbers by $3$ (in one of $n$ ways). There are $2+1=3$ ways to do this with one term, $3+2=5$ with two, $7$ with three, $9$ with four, and $11$ with five. The resulting number of possible sequences is $3 \\cdot 1 + 5 \\cdot 4 + 7 \\cdot 6 + 9 \\cdot 4 + 11 \\cdot 1 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(A) }112}$ . ~ emerald_block  Consider the arrangement of the prime factors of 96 in a line $(2,2, 2, 2, 2, 3)$ .  An arrangement of factors can be created by placing \"dividers\" to group primes.  For example, $(2, 2, |, 2, 2, 2, |, 3)$ is equivalent to the arrangement $4 \\cdot 8 \\cdot 3$ .  Because there are $6$ ways to order the prime factors, and $2^5$ ways to place dividers, this gives us an initial $6 \\cdot  2^5$ ways to arrange divisors. However, through this method, we overcount cases where $3$ is combined with another factor.  For example, the arrangement $4 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 4$ can be written as $(2, 2, |, 2, 3, |, 2, 2)$ or $(2, 2, |, 3, 2, |, 2, 2)$ .  Precisely, we double count any case with $6$ as a factor, triple count any case with $12$ , quadruple count any case with $24$ , etc. Now, consider all cases where $3$ must be grouped with at least one $2$ .  This can be expressed in the same \"line\" format as $(2, 2, 2, 2, 6)$ , where dividers can again be placed to group divisors.  In this case, there are $5$ ways to order divisors, and $2^4$ ways to place dividers, so we have an $5 \\cdot 2^4$ possible sequences for this case.  Notice that in this format, we double count cases where $12$ is a factor, we triple count cases where $24$ is a factor, etc.  Precisely, for any case counted $n$ times in the first step, it is counted $n - 1$ times in this step.  Thus, if we subtract, we count each case exactly once. So, we get: $6 \\cdot  2^5 - 5 \\cdot 2^4 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(A) }112}$ . ~ hdai1122  First we factor $32$ into $m$ numbers $g_1, \\cdots, g_m$ where $g_i>1,i=1,\\ldots,m$ . By applying stars and bars there are $\\binom{5-1}{m-1}$ ways. Then we can either insert $3$ into each of the $m+1$ spaces between (or beyond) $g_i$ 's, or multiply it to one of the $g_i$ 's, a total of $2m+1$ ways. Hence the answer to the problem is \\[\\sum_{m=1}^5 (2m+1)\\binom{5-1}{m-1} = \\sum_{n=0}^4 (2n+3) \\binom{4}{n} = 8\\sum_{n=0}^4 \\frac{n}{4} \\binom{4}{n} + 3 \\sum_{n=0}^4 \\binom{4}{n} = 8 \\sum_{n=0}^4 \\binom{3}{n-1} + 3\\sum_{n=0}^4 \\binom{4}{n} = 8 \\cdot 2^3 + 3\\cdot 2^4 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(A) }112}.\\]  ~ asops Note that $96 = 2^5 \\cdot 3$ . $D(n)$ depends on dividing $2^5$ into different terms, which is the integer partition of $5$ . Divide $96$ into $1$ term: There is only one way. $\\underline{\\textbf{1}}$  Divide $96$ into $2$ terms: Case $1$ : $3$ is alone $(2^5,3)$ has ${\\textbf{2}}$ different arrangements. Case $2$ : $3$ is with $2^n$  $5 = 1 + 4 = 2 + 3$ . For $(2, 2^4)$ and $(2^2, 2^3)$ , $3$ can be with any term from the $2$ tuples, and the number of  arrangement of the $2$ terms is $2$ . $2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 = {\\textbf{8}}$  $2 + 8 = \\underline{\\textbf{10}}$  Divide $96$ into $3$ terms: Case $1$ : $3$ is alone $5 = 2 + 3 = 1 + 4$ . For $(2^2, 2^3, 3)$ and $(2, 2^4, 3)$ , there are $3!$ arrangements each. $2 \\cdot 3! = {\\textbf{12}}$  Case $2$ : $3$ is with $2^n$  $5 = 1 + 1 + 3 = 1 + 2 + 2$ . For $(2, 2, 2^3)$ and $(2, 2^2, 2^2)$ , $3$ can be with any term from the $2$ tuples. If $3$ is with $2^3$ for the first tuple, or $2$ for the second tuple, the number of arrangements is $3$ for each. If $3$ is with $2$ for the first tuple, or $2^2$ for the second tuple, the number of arrangements is $6$ for each. $2 \\cdot 3 + 2 \\cdot 6 = {\\textbf{18}}$  $12 + 18 = \\underline{\\textbf{30}}$  Divide $96$ into $4$ terms: Case $1$ : $3$ is alone $5 = 1 + 1 + 3 = 1 + 2 + 2$ . For $(2, 2, 2^3, 3)$ and $(2, 2^2, 2^2, 3)$ , there are $\\frac{4!}{2!}$ arrangements each. $2 \\cdot \\frac{4!}{2!} = {\\textbf{24}}$  Case $2$ : $3$ is with $2^n$  $5 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 2$ . For $(2, 2, 2, 2^2)$ , $3$ can be with any term from the tuple. If $3$ is with $2^2$ , the number of arrangements is $\\frac{4!}{3!}$ . If $3$ is with $2$ , the number of arrangements is $\\frac{4!}{2!}$ . $\\frac{4!}{3!} + \\frac{4!}{2!} = {\\textbf{16}}$  $24 + 16 = \\underline{\\textbf{40}}$  Divide $96$ into $5$ terms: When dividing $5$ into $5$ parts there are $2$ cases. Case $1$ : $3$ is alone $5 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 2$ . For $(2, 2, 2, 2^2, 3)$ , there are $\\frac{5!}{3!}$ arrangements. $\\frac{5!}{3!} = {\\textbf{20}}$  Case $2$ : $3$ is with $2^n$  $5 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1$ . For $(2, 2, 2, 2, 2)$ , $3$ can only be with $2$ . The number of arrangements is $\\frac{5!}{4!} = \\textbf{5}$  $20 + 5 = \\underline{\\textbf{25}}$  Divide $96$ into $6$ terms: $5 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1$ . The number of arrangements of $(2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3)$ is $\\frac{6!}{5!} = \\underline{\\textbf{6}}$   $1 + 10 + 30 + 40 + 25 + 6 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(A) }112}$  ~ isabelchen  Ignore the $3$ first and first count $2^{x_1+x_2+...+x^n}=32$ which $x_1+x_2+...+x_n=5$ . This implies that $n$ is less than or equal to $5$ . Now, we can see that $3$ can lie between the two $x_i, x_{i+1}$ , or contribute to one of them. This gives $2k+1$ if $x_1+...+x_k=5$ . Now, just sum up gives $\\binom{5-1}{5-1}\\cdot 11+\\binom{5-1}{4-1}\\cdot 9+\\binom{5-1}{3-1}\\cdot 7+\\binom{5-1}{2-1}\\cdot 5+\\binom{5-1}{1-1}\\cdot 3=\\boxed{112}$ . Consider how we partition the factors of $96 = 2^5\\cdot 3$ . For each $k$ , there are two cases. Either we can put the $2$ s into $k$ nonzero parts, so that the $3$ shares a partition with some $2$ s, which can be done in $k\\binom{5-(k-1)+(k-1)-1}{k-2} = k\\binom{4}{k-2}$ ways, or we can put the $2$ s into $k-1$ nonzero parts and put the $3$ in its own partition, which can be done in $k\\binom{5-k+k-1}{k-1} = k\\binom{4}{k-1}$ ways. Summing over all $k$ , we have \\[\\sum_{k=1}^6 \\binom{4}{k-2} + \\sum_{k=1}^6 \\binom{4}{k-1}.\\]  But $\\sum_{k=1}^6 \\binom{4}{k-2} = 2\\binom{4}{0}+3\\binom{4}{1} + \\dots + 6\\binom{4}{4} = 4 \\cdot \\sum_{i=0}^4 \\binom{4}{i} = 4 \\cdot 2^4 = 64$ . Similarly, $\\sum_{k=1}^6 \\binom{4}{k-1} = 3\\cdot 2^4 = 48$ .

From the region graph, notice that in order to maximize $P(a)$ , $a\\geq\\tfrac{1}{2}$ . We can solve the rest with geometric probability. Instead of maximizing $P(a)$ , we minimize $Q(a)=1-P(a)$ . $Q(a)$ consists of two squares (each broken into two triangles), one of area $\\tfrac{1}{4}$ and another of area $(a-\\tfrac 12)^2$ . To calculate $Q(a)$ , we divide this area by $a$ , so \\[Q(a) = \\frac{1}{a}\\left(\\frac{1}{4}+(a-\\tfrac 12)^2\\right) = \\frac{1}{a}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}+a^2-a\\right)= a+\\frac 1{2a}-1.\\]  By AM-GM, $a+\\frac{1}{2a}\\geq 2\\sqrt{\\frac{a}{2a}}=\\sqrt{2}$ , which we can achieve by setting $a=\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$ .

We now express $P$ as a function of $b=(1-a)$ . The triangle on the right of the line $x=b$ is an isosceles right triangle with altitude $b$ , so it has area $b^2$ . The total area of the region to the left of $x=b$ has area $1-b$ . So \\[P(b) = \\frac{1/2 - b^2}{1-b}\\] Differentiating using the quotient rule, we find $P$ has local extrema at \\[P'(b) = \\frac{(1-h)(-2h)-(-1/2 - h^2)(-1)}{(1-h)^2} = 0\\] Setting the numerator equal to $0$ and solving the quadratic, we find $P$ has extrema at $b = 1 \\pm \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$ .

      " The top left rectangle can be $5$ possible colors. Then the bottom left region can only be $4$ possible colors, and the bottom middle can only be $3$ colors since it is next to the top left and bottom left. Similarly, we have $3$ choices for the top right and $3$ choices for the bottom right, which gives us a total of $5\\cdot4\\cdot3\\cdot3\\cdot3=\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) }540}$ . ~Txu Case 1: All the rectangles are different colors. It would be $5! = 120$ choices. Case 2: Two rectangles that are the same color. Grouping these two rectangles as one gives us $5\\cdot4\\cdot3\\cdot2 = 120$ . But, you need to multiply this number by three because the same-colored rectangles can be chosen at the top left and bottom right, the top right and bottom left, or the bottom right and bottom left, which gives us a grand total of $360$ . Case 3: We have two sets of rectangles chosen from these choices (top right & bottom left, top left & bottom right) that have the same color. However, the choice of the bottom left and bottom right does not work for this case, as the second pair would be chosen from two touching rectangles. Again, grouping the same-colored rectangles gives us $5\\cdot4\\cdot3 = 60$ . Therefore, we have $120 + 360 + 60 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(D) }540}$ . ~ orenbad  https://youtu.be/d_yfk7pYsSw  ~Education, the Study of Everything https://youtu.be/7yAh4MtJ8a8?si=88gRS7RBVbN7yCng&t=1290  ~Math-X https://youtu.be/SRV4e74qsM8 \n",

      " Note that: Truth-tellers would answer yes-no-no to the three questions in this order. Liars would answer yes-yes-no to the three questions in this order. Alternaters who responded truth-lie-truth would answer no-no-no to the three questions in this order. Alternaters who responded lie-truth-lie would answer yes-yes-yes to the three questions in this order. Suppose that there are $T$ truth-tellers, $L$ liars, and $A$ alternaters who responded lie-truth-lie. The conditions of the first two questions imply that \\begin{align*} T+L+A&=22, \\\\ L+A&=15. \\end{align*} Subtracting the second equation from the first, we have $T=22-15=\\boxed{\\textbf{(A) } 7}.$  Remark  The condition of the third question is extraneous. However, we know that there are $9$ alternaters who responded lie-truth-lie, $6$ liars, and $9$ alternaters who responded truth-lie-truth from this condition. ~sigma ~ orenbad ~MRENTHUSIASM Consider when the principal asks \"Are you a liar?\": The truth tellers truthfully say no, and the liars lie and say no. This leaves only alternaters who lie on this question to answer yes. Thus, all $9$ children that answered yes are alternaters that falsely answer Questions 1 and 3, and truthfully answer Question 2. The rest of the alternaters, however many there are, have the opposite behavior. Consider the second question, \"Are you an alternater?\": The truth tellers again answer no, the liars falsely answer yes, and alternaters that truthfully answer also say yes. From the previous part, we know that $9$ alternaters truthfully answer here. Because only liars and $9$ alternaters answer yes, we can deduce that there are $15-9=6$ liars. Consider the first question, \"Are you a truth teller?\": Truth tellers say yes, liars also say yes, and alternaters that lie on this question also say yes. From the first part, we know that $9$ alternaters lie here. From the previous part, we know that there are $6$ liars. Because only the number of truth tellers is unknown here, we can deduce that there are $22-9-6=7$ truth tellers. The final question is how many pieces of candy did the principal give to truth tellers. Because truth tellers answer yes on only the first question, we know that all $7$ of them said yes once, resulting in $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A) } 7}$ pieces of candy. ~phuang1024 Note that we have $4$ types of people: $T,$ The truth tellers, who will answer yes-no-no to the questions. $L,$ The liars, who will answer yes-yes-no to the questions. $A,$ The alternators who START truthfully, who will answer yes-yes-yes to the questions. The alternators who START by lying, who will answer no-no-no to the questions. Given this information, it is reasonable to ignore the fourth type, because they will never answer yes to any question. Hence, we only consider people of type $1, 2,$ and $3.$  The principal's first question implies that \\[T + L + A = 22.\\] The second question implies that \\[L + A = 15.\\] The third question implies that \\[A = 9.\\]  Solving, we find that $T = 7,$ so $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A) } 7}$ is our answer. We can also note that $T = 7,  L = 6,  A = 9,$ and there are $9$ alternators who answer no to every question. ~xHypotenuse This problem is broken in an interesting way that helps the test-taker. Since the true answers alternate for alternaters, you can still get the correct answer if you misinterpret the problem as \"alternaters alternate their yes/no answers, but not their truth values\". Suppose that $A$ alternaters answer yes-no-yes, and $A'$ alternaters answer no-yes-no. You still get $A=A'=9$ . In addition, you can even get the correct answer with the misinterpretation \"alternaters have two types: alternaters of the same type give the same arbitrary answers to the three questions, and alternaters of different types give the opposite arbitrary answers to the three questions\". It's also notable that the misinterpretation makes the problem harder, so that the solution actually relies on all the information. This suggests that the question-writer may have been mistaken but got lucky. ~oinava, based on demonstration of misinterpretation fakesolve by ~ orenbad  https://youtu.be/9IQRgWn4NAk  ~Education, the Study of Everything https://youtu.be/7yAh4MtJ8a8?si=_jfMzsAiHgAGJ1uo&t=1552  ~Math-X https://youtu.be/ZSwg-xKAQiM \n",

This product is a perfect square, and thus the sum of the digits of the fourth smallest perfect square triangular number is therefore $4+1+6+1+6=\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) 18}}$ . ~kingme271 According to the problem, we want to find integer $p$ such $\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}=p^2$ , after expanding, we have $n^2+n=2p^2, 4n^2+4n=8p^2, (2n+1)^2-8p^2=1$ , we call $2n+1=q$ , the equation becomes $q^2-8p^2=1$ , obviously $(q,p)=(3,1)$ is the elementary solution for this pell equation, thus the forth smallest solution set $q_4+2\\sqrt{2}p_4=(3+2\\sqrt{2})^4=577+408\\sqrt{2}$ , which indicates $p=204, p^2=41616$ leads to $\\boxed{18}$  ~bluesoul If $n \\choose 2$ is a square, then ${(2n-1)^2 \\choose 2}$ is also a square. We can prove this quite simply: \\[{(2n-1)^2 \\choose 2}\\]  \\[= \\frac{(2n-1)^2 \\cdot ((2n-1)^2 - 1)}{2}\\]  \\[= \\frac{(2n-1)^2 \\cdot (2n \\cdot (2n - 2))}{2}\\]  \\[= (2n-1)^2 \\cdot 4{n \\choose 2}.\\]  Therefore, ${(2 \\cdot 9 - 1)^2 \\choose 2}$ is a square. Note that $T_n = {n+1 \\choose 2}$ . We can easily check all smaller possibilities using a bit of casework, and they don't work. Our solution is thus ${289 \\choose 2} = 204^2 = 41616$ , and so the answer is $\\boxed{18}$ . ~mathboy100 We want to find integer $n_i$ and $m_i$ such that $t_{n_i} =\\frac{n_i (n_i + 1)}{2}=m_i^2, n_0 = 0.$  We use the formula $\\sqrt{n_{i+1}} = \\sqrt{2n_i} + \\sqrt{n_i + 1}$ and get \\[n_1 = ( \\sqrt{2n_0} + \\sqrt{n_0 + 1})^2 = (0+1)^2 = 1,\\]  \\[n_2= ( \\sqrt{2n_1} + \\sqrt{n_1 + 1})^2 = ( \\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{1 + 1})^2 = 8,\\]  \\[n_3= ( \\sqrt{2n_2} + \\sqrt{n_2 + 1})^2 = ( \\sqrt{16} + \\sqrt{8 + 1})^2 = 49,\\]  \\[n_4 = ( \\sqrt{2n_3} + \\sqrt{n_3 + 1})^2 = ( \\sqrt{98} + \\sqrt{49 + 1})^2 =  ((7 + 5)\\sqrt{2})^2 = 288,\\]  \\[n_5 = ( \\sqrt{2n_4} + \\sqrt{n_4 + 1})^2 = ( \\sqrt{576} + \\sqrt{289})^2 =  (24 + 17)^2 = 1681,\\]  \\[n_6 = ( \\sqrt{2n_5} + \\sqrt{n_5 + 1})^2 = ( 41\\sqrt{2} + \\sqrt{1682})^2 =  ((41 + 29)\\sqrt{2})^2 = 9800,...\\] Therefore, $t_{n_4} = t_{288} = \\frac{288\\cdot289}{2} = 41616 \\implies 4+1+6+1+6=\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) 18}}$  Pell's equation (simple solutions) vladimir.shelomovskii@gmail.com, vvsss  This is an easy one to tackle by just noticing a pattern. Write out all the perfect squares before 300, and then notice that 4 and 9 are what are the factors of the 8th term. 25 and 49 are factors of the 49th term. 4 multiplied by 2 is one less then 9. 25 multiplied by 2 is one more than 49. Well, then we keep on writing out the perfect squares and then hunt for any that can be multiplied by two and then has an absolute value of 1 valued difference. 144 and 289 satisfy this. 288th term would give us these factors. By the way, this isn't  very rigorous. No formula needed. Emily Q\n",

      " We are given that $a\\cdot(\\sin{x}+\\sin{(2x)})=\\sin{(3x)}$  Using the sine double angle formula combine with the fact that $\\sin{(3x)} = \\sin{x}\\cdot(4\\cos^2{x}-1)$ , which can be derived using sine angle addition with $\\sin{(2x + x)}$ , we have \\[a\\cdot(\\sin{x}+2\\sin{x}\\cos{x})=\\sin{x}\\cdot(4\\cos^2{x}-1)\\] Since $\\sin{x} \\ne 0$ as it is on the open interval $(0, \\pi)$ , we can divide out $\\sin{x}$ from both sides, leaving us with \\[a\\cdot(1+2\\cos{x})=4\\cos^2{x}-1\\] Now, distributing $a$ and rearranging, we achieve the equation \\[4\\cos^2{x} - 2a\\cos{x} - (1+a) = 0\\] which is a quadratic in $\\cos{x}$ . Applying the quadratic formula to solve for $\\cos{x}$ , we get \\[\\cos{x} =\\frac{2a\\pm\\sqrt{4a^2+4(4)(1+a)}}{8}\\] and expanding the terms under the radical, we get \\[\\cos{x} =\\frac{2a\\pm\\sqrt{4a^2+16a+16}}{8}\\] Factoring, since $4a^2+16a+16 = (2a+4)^2$ , we can simplify our expression even further to \\[\\cos{x} =\\frac{a\\pm(a+2)}{4}\\]  Now, solving for our two solutions, $\\cos{x} = -\\frac{1}{2}$ and $\\cos{x} = \\frac{a+1}{2}$ . Since $\\cos{x} = -\\frac{1}{2}$ yields a solution that is valid for all $a$ , that being $x = \\frac{2\\pi}{3}$ , we must now solve for the case where $\\frac{a+1}{2}$ yields a valid value. As $x\\in (0, \\pi)$ , $\\cos{x}\\in (-1, 1)$ , and therefore $\\frac{a+1}{2}\\in (-1, 1)$ , and $a\\in(-3,1)$ . There is one more case we must consider inside this interval though, the case where $\\frac{a+1}{2} = -\\frac{1}{2}$ , as this would lead to a double root for $\\cos{x}$ , yielding only one valid solution for $x$ . Solving for this case, $a \\ne -2$ . Therefore, combining this fact with our solution interval, $a\\in(-3, -2) \\cup (-2, 1)$ , so the answer is $-3-2+1 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(A) } {-}4}$ . - DavidHovey We can optimize from the step from \\[a\\cdot(1+2\\cos{x})=4\\cos^2{x}-1\\] in solution 1 by writing \\[a = \\frac{4\\cos^2{x}-1}{1+2\\cos{x}} = 2\\cos x - 1\\]  and then get \\[\\cos x = \\frac{a+1}{2}.\\]  Now, solving for our two solutions, $\\cos{x} = -\\frac{1}{2}$ and $\\cos{x} = \\frac{a+1}{2}$ . Since $\\cos{x} = -\\frac{1}{2}$ yields a solution that is valid for all $a$ , that being $x = \\frac{2\\pi}{3}$ , we must now solve for the case where $\\frac{a+1}{2}$ yields a valid value.

Use the double angle formula on the RHS to obtain $a\\cdot\\sin{\\frac{3x}{2}}\\cos{\\frac{x}{2}}=\\sin{\\frac{3x}{2}}\\cos{\\frac{3x}{2}}$ . From here, it is obvious that $x=\\frac{2\\pi}{3}$ is always a solution, and thus we divide by $\\sin{\\frac{3x}{2}}$ to get \\[a\\cdot\\cos{\\frac{x}{2}}=\\cos{\\frac{3x}{2}}\\] We wish to find all $a$ such that there is at least one more solution to this equation distinct from $x=\\frac{2\\pi}{3}$ . Letting $y=\\cos{\\frac{x}{2}}$ , and noting that $\\cos{\\frac{3x}{2}}=4y^3-3y$ , we can rearrange our equation to $4y^3=y(3+a)$ The smallest value $x$ where $y=0$ is $\\pi$ , which is not in our domain so we divide by $y$ to obtain $4y^2=a+3$ . By the trivial inequality, $a+3\\ge{0}$ . Furthermore, $y\\neq{0}$ , so $a+3>0$ . Also, if $a=-2$ , then the solution to this equation would be shared with $x=\\frac{2\\pi}{3}$ , so there would only be one distinct solution. Finally, because $y\\le{1}$ due to the restrictions of a sine wave, and that $y\\neq{1}$ due to the restrictions on $x$ , we have $-3<a<1$ with $a\\neq{-2}$ . Thus, $p=-3,q=-2, r=1$ , so our final answer is $-3+(-2)+1=\\boxed{\\textbf{(A) } {-}4}$ . ~sigma https://youtu.be/Tl5hBEkHzbA  ~Education, the Study of Everything https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0gCMvUmZtpI \n",

      " Let $P=(r,\\theta)$ be a point in polar coordinates, where $\\theta$ is in degrees. Rotating $P$ by $k^{\\circ}$ counterclockwise around the origin gives the transformation $(r,\\theta)\\rightarrow(r,\\theta+k^{\\circ}).$ Reflecting $P$ across the $y$ -axis gives the transformation $(r,\\theta)\\rightarrow(r,180^{\\circ}-\\theta).$ Note that \\begin{align*} T_k(P)&=(r,180^{\\circ}-\\theta-k^{\\circ}), \\\\ T_{k+1}(T_k(P)) &= (r,\\theta -1^{\\circ}). \\end{align*} We start with $(1,0^{\\circ})$ in polar coordinates. For the sequence of transformations $T_1, T_2, T_3, \\cdots, T_k,$ it follows that After $T_1,$ we have $(1,179^{\\circ}).$ After $T_2,$ we have $(1,-1^{\\circ}).$ After $T_3,$ we have $(1,178^{\\circ}).$ After $T_4,$ we have $(1,-2^{\\circ}).$ After $T_5,$ we have $(1,177^{\\circ}).$ After $T_6,$ we have $(1,-3^{\\circ}).$ ... After $T_{2k-1},$ we have $(1,180^{\\circ}-k^{\\circ}).$ After $T_{2k},$ we have $(1,-k^{\\circ}).$ The least such positive integer $k$ is $180.$ Therefore, the least such positive integer $n$ is $2k-1=\\boxed{\\textbf{(A) } 359}.$  ~MRENTHUSIASM Note that since we're reflecting across the $y$ -axis, if the point ever makes it to $(-1,0)$ then it will flip back to the original point. Note that after $T_1$ the point will be $1$ degree clockwise from the negative $x$ -axis. Applying $T_2$ will rotate it to be $1$ degree counterclockwise from the negative $x$ -axis, and then flip it so that it is $1$ degree clockwise from the positive $x$ -axis. Therefore, after every $2$ transformations, the point rotates $1$ degree clockwise. To rotate it so that it will rotate $179$ degrees clockwise will require $179 \\cdot 2 = 358$ transformations. Then finally on the last transformation, it will rotate on to $(-1,0)$ and then flip back to its original position. Therefore, the answer is $358+1 = 359 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(A) } 359}$ . ~KingRavi In degrees: Starting with $n=0$ , the sequence goes ${0}\\rightarrow {179}\\rightarrow {359}\\rightarrow {178}\\rightarrow {358}\\rightarrow {177}\\rightarrow {357}\\rightarrow\\cdots.$  We see that it takes $2$ steps to downgrade the point by $1^{\\circ}$ . Since the $1$ st point in the sequence is ${179}$ , the answer is $1+2(179)=\\boxed{\\textbf{(A) } 359}.$  We recognize that the reflection actually just makes it turn clockwise. So, each time it turns the step degree. Looking at the answer choices, the closest number to make a multiple of 360 is 359, which leads us to our answer D. This is because (1+359)359/2 = something with 360, so we get the reflection back to the spot. https://youtu.be/QQrsKTErJn8  ~Steven Chen (Professor Chen Education Palace, www.professorchenedu.com) https://youtu.be/7yAh4MtJ8a8?si=2UC_9X7DjkL8UW5C&t=4968  ~Math-X   2022 AMC 10A ( Problems • Answer Key • Resources )   Preceded by Problem 17   Followed by Problem 19    1  •  2  •  3  •  4  •  5  •  6  •  7  •  8  •  9  •  10  •  11  •  12  •  13  •  14  •  15  •  16  •  17  •  18  •  19  •  20  •  21  •  22  •  23  •  24  •  25    All AMC 10 Problems and Solutions    2022 AMC 12A ( Problems • Answer Key • Resources )   Preceded by Problem 17   Followed by Problem 19    1  •  2  •  3  •  4  •  5  •  6  •  7  •  8  •  9  •  10  •  11  •  12  •  13  •  14  •  15  •  16  •  17  •  18  •  19  •  20  •  21  •  22  •  23  •  24  •  25    All AMC 12 Problems and Solutions  The problems on this page are copyrighted by the Mathematical Association of America 's American Mathematics Competitions .

      " $P(x) = x^{2022} + x^{1011} + 1$ is equal to $\\frac{x^{3033}-1}{x^{1011}-1}$ by difference of powers. Therefore, the answer is a polynomial that divides $x^{3033}-1$ but not $x^{1011}-1$ . Note that any polynomial $x^m-1$ divides $x^n-1$ if and only if $m$ is a factor of $n$ . The prime factorizations of $1011$ and $3033$ are $3*337$ and $3^2*337$ , respectively. Hence, $x^9-1$ is a divisor of $x^{3033}-1$ but not $x^{1011}-1$ . By difference of powers, $x^9-1=(x^3-1)(x^6+x^3+1)$ .\n",
      "Therefore, the answer is $\\boxed{E}$ . We simply test roots for each, as $2022,1011$ are multiples of three, we need to make sure the roots are in the form of $e^{i\\frac{k\\pi}{9}}$ , so we only have to look at $D,E$ . If we look at choice $E$ , $x=e^{i\\frac{\\pm2\\pi}{9}}$ which works perfectly, the answer is just $E$  ~bluesoul Let $x^{1011} = u$ , now we can rewrite our polynomial as $u^2+u+1$ . Using the quadratic formula to solve for the roots of this polynomial, we have \\[x^{1011} = \\frac{-1\\pm i\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\] Looking at our answer choices, we want to find a polynomial whose roots satisfy this expression. Since the expression $x^6+x^3+1$ is in a similar form to our original polynomial, except with $x^3$ in place of $x^{1011}$ , this would be a good place to start. Solving for the roots of $x^3$ in a similar fashion, \\[x^3= \\frac{-1\\pm i\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\] for the solution we are testing. Now notice that we can rewrite the roots of $x^3$ as \\[x^3 = \\operatorname{cis}{\\frac{2\\pi}{3}}, \\operatorname{cis}{\\frac{4\\pi}{3}}\\] Both of which are third roots of unity. We want to now check if this value of $x^3$ satisfies $x^{1011} = \\frac{-1\\pm i\\sqrt{3}}{2}$ . Notice that $x^{1011} = (x^{3})^{112\\cdot3}\\cdot x^3$ , and since both values of $x^3$ are roots of unity, we can simplify the expression we want satisfied to the expression to $x^{1011}=x^3$ . Since both values of $x^3$ are also values of $x^{1011}$ , the roots for our $x^6+x^3+1$ are also roots of $x^{2022}+x^{1011}+1$ , meaning that \\[x^6+x^3+1 | x^{2022}+x^{1011}+1\\] so Therefore, the answer is $\\boxed{E}$ . - DavidHovey We know that a monic polynomial $q$ divides a monic polynomial $p$ if and only if all the roots of $q$ are roots of $p.$ Since \\[P(x)=x^{2022}+x^{1011}+1=\\frac{x^{3033}-1}{x^{1011}-1}\\] , the roots of $P$ are the $3033$ rd roots of unity that aren't $1011$ th roots of unity. Now, note that: 1: The roots of polynomial $A$ are the primitive $6$ th roots of unity. 2: The roots of polynomial $B$ are the primitive cube roots of unity. 3: The roots of polynomial $C$ are the primitive $8$ th roots of unity. 4: The roots of polynomial $D$ are the primitive $18$ th roots of unity. 5: The roots of polynomial $E$ are the primitive $9$ th roots of unity. However, since $6$ , $8$ , and $18$ don't divide $3033$ , the roots of polynomial $A$ are not all $3033$ rd roots of unity, and the same is true for polynomials $C$ and $D$ , eliminating choices $A$ , $C$ and $D.$ Also, since $3$ divides $1011$ , the roots of polynomial $B$ are all $1011$ th roots of unity, eliminating choice $B.$ That leaves choice $\\boxed{E}$ , and we can confirm that this is correct by noticing that $9$ divides $3033$ but not $1011.$ From that, we can see that the roots of polynomial $E$ are $3033$ rd roots of unity but not $1011$ th roots of unity, so they are all roots of $P.$ Therefore, $E$ divides $P.$  ~pianoboy Put the value $x = -1$ . This gives $P(-1) = (-1)^{2022} + (-1)^{1011} + 1 = 1$ .\n",

This leaves us with only $2$ choices, $B$ and $E$ . Notice that letting $x=0$ or $x=1$ still make these answer choices work and the other values will leave large numbers for us to check which is not feasible in a 75 minutes math competition. However, we notice answer choice $B$ is quadratic so if answer choice $B$ divides the given polynomial, then the roots of the quadratic must also be roots of the polynomial. Through quadratic formula, we find the roots of this quadratic as $\\dfrac{-1+i\\sqrt{3}}{2}$ and $\\dfrac{-1-i\\sqrt{3}}{2}$ . We notice that these roots can be written nicely in polar form $\\cos(\\dfrac{2\\pi}{3})+i\\sin(\\dfrac{2\\pi}{3})$ or $\\cos(\\dfrac{4\\pi}{3})+i\\sin(\\dfrac{4\\pi}{3})$ . We plug either one of these (preferably the root on the left as it is smaller) and see that the polynomial doesn't equal $0$ suggesting that $B$ is not the correct answer choice.

      "Thus, $|c| = 2 \\sqrt{5} \\approx \\boxed{\\textbf{(A) 4.5}}$ . ~Steven Chen (Professor Chen Education Palace, www.professorchenedu.com) Because $z^2 - cz + 10 = 0$ , notice that $|z_1||z_2|=|10|=10$ . Furthermore, note that because $c$ is real, $z_2=\\bar z_1$ . Thus, $\\frac{1}{z_1}=\\frac{\\bar z_1}{z_1\\cdot{\\bar z_1}}=\\frac{z_2}{|z_1|^2}=\\frac{z_2}{100}$ . Similarly, $\\frac{1}{z_2}=\\frac{z_1}{100}$ . On the complex coordinate plane, let $z_1=A_2$ , $z_2=B_2$ , $\\frac{1}{z_2}=A_1$ , $\\frac{1}{z_1}=B_1$ . Notice how $OA_1B_1$ is similar to $OA_2B_2$ . Thus, the area of $A_1B_1B_2B_1$ is $(k)(OA_2B_2)$ for some constant $k$ , and $OA_2B_2 =$ (In progress) Since $c$ , which is the sum of roots $z_1$ and $z_2$ , is real, $z_1=\\overline{z_2}$ . Let $z_1=a+bi$ . Then $z_2=a-bi$ . Note that the product of the roots is $10$ by Vieta's, so $z_1z_2=(a+bi)(a-bi)=a^2+b^2=10$ . Thus, $\\frac{1}{z_1}=\\frac{1}{a-bi}\\cdot\\frac{a+bi}{a+bi}=\\frac{a+bi}{a^2+b^2}=\\frac{a+bi}{10}$ . With the same process, $\\frac{1}{z_2}=\\frac{a-bi}{10}$ . So, our four points are $a+bi,\\frac{a+bi}{10},a-bi,$ and $\\frac{a-bi}{10}$ . WLOG let $a+bi$ be in the first quadrant and graph these four points on the complex plane. Notice how quadrilateral Q is a trapezoid with the real axis as its axis of symmetry. It has a short base with endpoints $\\frac{a+bi}{10}$ and $\\frac{a-bi}{10}$ , so its length is $\\left|\\frac{a+bi}{10} - \\frac{a-bi}{10}\\right| =\\frac{b}{5}$ . Likewise, its long base has endpoints $a+bi$ and $a-bi$ , so its length is $|(a+bi)-(a-bi)|=2b$ . The height, which is the distance between the two lines, is the difference between the real values of the two bases $\\implies h= a-\\frac{a}{10}=\\frac{9a}{10}$ . Plugging these into the area formula for a trapezoid, we are trying to maximize $\\frac12\\cdot\\left(2b+\\frac{b}{5}\\right)\\cdot\\frac{9a}{10}=\\frac{99ab}{100}$ . Thus, the only thing we need to maximize is $ab$ . With the restriction that $a^2+b^2=(a-b)^2+2ab=10$ , $ab$ is maximized when $a=b=\\sqrt{5}$ . Remember, $c$ is the sum of the roots, so $c=z_1+z_2=2a=2\\sqrt5=\\sqrt{20}\\approx\\boxed{4.5}$  ~quacker88 Like the solutions above we can know that $|z_1| = |z_2| = \\sqrt{10}$ and $z_1=\\overline{z_2}$ . Let $z_1=\\sqrt{10}e^{i\\theta}$ where $0<\\theta<\\pi$ , then $z_2=\\sqrt{10}e^{-i\\theta}$ , $\\frac{1}{z_1}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{10}}e^{-i\\theta}$ , $\\frac{1}{z_2}= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{10}}e^{i\\theta}$ . On the basis of symmetry, the area $A$ of $\\mathcal{Q}$ is the difference between two isoceles triangles,so $2A=10\\sin2\\theta-\\frac{1}{10}\\sin2\\theta\\leq10-\\frac{1}{10}$ . The inequality holds when $2\\theta=\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ , or $\\theta=\\frac{\\pi}{4}$ . Thus, $c= 2 {\\rm Re} \\ z_1 =2 \\sqrt{10} \\cos\\frac{\\pi}{4}=\\sqrt{20} \\approx \\boxed{\\textbf{(A) 4.5}}$ . ~PluginL Like in Solution 3, we find that $Q = \\frac12\\cdot\\left(2b+\\frac{b}{5}\\right)\\cdot\\frac{9a}{10}= \\frac{99}{100}ab$ , thus, $Q$ is maximized when $ab$ is maximized. $ab = a \\cdot \\sqrt{10 - a^2} = \\sqrt{10a^2 - a^4}$ , let $f(a) =  \\sqrt{10a^2 - a^4}$ . By the Chain Rule and the Power Rule, $f'(a) = \\frac12 \\cdot (10a^2 - a^4)^{-\\frac12} \\cdot (10(2a)-4a^3)) = \\frac{20a-4a^3}{ 2\\sqrt{10a^2 - a^4} } = \\frac{10a-2a^3}{ \\sqrt{10a^2 - a^4} }$  $f'(a) = 0$ , $10a-2a^3 = 0$ , $a \\neq 0$ , $a^2 = 5$ , $a = \\sqrt{5}$  $\\because f'(a) = 0$ when $a = \\sqrt{5}$ , $f'(a)$ is positive when $a < \\sqrt{5}$ , and $f'(a)$ is negative when $a > \\sqrt{5}$  $\\therefore f(a)$ has a local maximum when $a = \\sqrt{5}$ . Notice that $ab = \\frac{ (a+b)^2 - (a^2+b^2) }{2} = \\frac{c^2 - 10}{2}$ , $\\frac{c^2 - 10}{2} = 5$ , $c = \\sqrt{2 \\cdot 5 + 10} = \\sqrt{20} \\approx \\boxed{\\text{(A) 4.5}}$  ~ isabelchen  https://youtu.be/7yAh4MtJ8a8?si=1NLsu57rYrEPP1A2&t=6893 ~Math-X https://youtube.com/watch?v=bbMcdvlPcyA  https://youtu.be/pcB2sg7Ag58  ~Steven Chen (Professor Chen Education Palace, www.professorchenedu.com)\n",

      " Suppose that with a pair $(a_i,b_i)$ the circle is an excircle. Then notice that the hypotenuse must be $(r-x)+(r-y)$ , so it must be the case that \\[a_i^2+b_i^2=(2r-a_i-b_i)^2.\\] Similarly, if with a pair $(a_i,b_i)$ the circle is an incircle, the hypotenuse must be $(x-r)+(y-r)$ , leading to the same equation. Notice that this equation can be simplified through SFFT to \\[(a_i-2r)(b_i-2r)=2r^2.\\] Thus, we want the smallest $r$ such that this equation has at least $14$ distinct pairs $(a_i,b_i)$ for which this holds. The obvious choice to check is $r=6$ . In this case, since $2r^2=2^3\\cdot 3^2$ has $12$ positive factors, we get $12$ pairs, and we get another two if the factors are $-8,-9$ or vice versa. One can check that for smaller values of $r$ , we do not even get close to $14$ possible pairs. When $r=6$ , the smallest possible $c$ -value is clearly when the factors are negative. When this occurs, $a_i=4, b_i=3$ (or vice versa), so the mimimal $c$ is $5$ . The largest possible $c$ -value occurs when the largest of $a_i$ and $b_i$ are maximized. This occurs when the factors are $72$ and $1$ , leading to $a_i=84, b_i=13$ (or vice-versa), leading to a maximal $c$ of $85$ . Hence the answer is $\\frac{85}5=\\boxed{17}$ . ~ bluelinfish Case 1: The tangent and the origin are on the opposite sides of the circle. In this case, $a, b > 2r$ . We can easily prove that \\[a + b - 2 r = c . \\hspace{1cm} (1)\\]  Recall that $c = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$ . Taking square of (1) and reorganizing all terms, (1) is converted as \\[\\left( a - 2 r \\right) \\left( b - 2 r \\right) = 2 r^2 .\\]  Case 2: The tangent and the origin are on the same sides of the circle. In this case, $0 < a, b < r$ . We can easily prove that \\[2 r - a - b  = c . \\hspace{1cm} (2)\\]  Recall that $c = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$ . Taking square of (2) and reorganizing all terms, (2) is converted as \\[\\left( a - 2 r \\right) \\left( b - 2 r \\right) = 2 r^2 .\\]  Putting both cases together, for given $r$ , we look for solutions of $a$ and $b$ satisfying \\[\\left( a - 2 r \\right) \\left( b - 2 r \\right) = 2 r^2 ,\\] with either $a, b > 2r$ or $0 < a, b < r$ . Now, we need to find the smallest $r$ , such that the number of feasible solutions of $(a, b)$ is at least 14. For equation \\[uv = 2 r^2 ,\\] we observe that the R.H.S. is a not a perfect square. Thus, the number of positive $(u, v)$ is equal to the number of positive divisors of $2 r^2$ . Second, for each feasible positive solution $(u, v)$ , its opposite $(-u, -v)$ is also a solution. However, $(u,v)$ corresponds to a feasible solution if $(a, b)$ with $a = u + 2r$ and $b = v + 2r$ , but $(-u, -v)$ may not lead to a feasible solution if $(a, b)$ with $a = 2 r - u$ and $b = 2 r - v$ . Recall that we are looking for $r$ that leads to at least 14 solutions.\n",
      "Therefore, the above observations imply that we must have $r$ , such that $2 r^2$ has least 7 positive divisors. Following this guidance, we find the smallest $r$ is 6.

The equation for the line that passes through $(0,a_i)$ and $(b_i,0)$ is $a_ix+b_iy-a_ib_i=0$ .

Notice that we only need to find $7$ triples with $a_i<b_i$ , the $7$ other triples will simply be $(b_i,a_i,c_i)$ . $a_i$ will not equal $b_i$ because then $c_i = a_i \\cdot \\sqrt{2}$ , meaning that $a_i$ , $b_i$ , and $c_i$ cannot all be integers. The $7$ smallest triples are: $(3,4,5)$ , $(5,12,13)$ , $(7,24,25)$ , $(8,15,17)$ , $(11,60,61)$ , $(12,35,37)$ , $(13,84,85)$  Therefore, $\\frac{c_{14}}{c_1} = \\frac{85}{5} = \\boxed{\\textbf{(E) 17}}$ . ~ isabelchen  https://youtu.be/7yAh4MtJ8a8?si=2dTtBDEZLIjN3YWS&t=9728 ~Math-X ~Steven Chen (Professor Chen Education Palace, www.professorchenedu.com) https://youtu.be/5jO__fUbgs8  ~r00tsOfUnity https://youtu.be/6RfGCTNQ2Jw  https://youtu.be/79CLeiJrPvs  ~MathProblemSolvingSkills.com   2022 AMC 12A ( Problems • Answer Key • Resources )   Preceded by Problem 24   Followed by Last Problem    1  •  2  •  3  •  4  •  5  •  6  •  7  •  8  •  9  •  10  •  11  •  12  •  13  •  14  •  15  •  16  •  17  •  18  •  19  •  20  •  21  •  22  •  23  •  24  •  25    All AMC 12 Problems and Solutions  The problems on this page are copyrighted by the Mathematical Association of America 's American Mathematics Competitions .

Using the quadratic formula , $x=\\frac{-k \\pm \\sqrt{k^2-144}}{2}.$ Since $4$ divides $144$ evenly, $k$ and $k^2-144$ have the same parity, so $x$ is an integer if and only if $k^2-144$ is a perfect square. Let $k^2-144=n^2.$ Then, $(k+n)(k-n)=144.$ Since $k$ is an integer and $144$ is even, $k+n$ and $k-n$ must both be even. Assuming that $k$ is positive, we get $5$ possible values of $k+n$ , namely $2, 4, 8, 6, 12$ , which will give distinct positive values of $k$ , but $k+n=12$ gives $k+n=k-n$ and $n=0$ , giving $2$ identical integer roots. Therefore, there are $4$ distinct positive values of $k.$ Multiplying that by $2$ to take the negative values into account, we get $4\\cdot2=\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }8}$ values of $k$ . ~pianoboy Proceed similar to Solution 2 and deduce that the discriminant of $x^{2}+kx+36$ must be a perfect square greater than $0$ to satisfy all given conditions. Seeing something like $k^2-144$ might remind us of a right triangle, where $k$ is the hypotenuse, and $12$ is a leg. There are four ways we could have this: a $9$ - $12$ - $15$ triangle, a $12$ - $16$ - $20$ triangle, a $5$ - $12$ - $13$ triangle, and a $12$ - $35$ - $37$ triangle. Multiply by $2$ to account for negative $k$ values (since $k$ is being squared), and our answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }8}$ . Since $36 = 2^2\\cdot3^2$ , that means there are $(2+1)(2+1) = 9$ possible factors of $36$ . Since $6 \\cdot 6$ violates the distinct root condition, subtract $1$ from $9$ to get $8$ . Each sum is counted twice, and we count of those twice for negatives. This cancels out, so we get $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }8}$ . ~songmath20  Edited 5.1.2023 https://youtu.be/WX871JJbdY4  ~Education, the Study of Everything https://youtu.be/SCwQ9jUfr0g  ~~Hayabusa1 https://youtu.be/_KNR0JV5rdI?t=679  https://youtube.com/watch?v=cnUq_Op3YzY&feature=shared  https://youtu.be/1qO3eejxuPo \n",

      " Since the equation has even powers of $x$ and $y$ , let $y'=y^2$ and $x' = x^2$ . Then $y'^2 + 1 = x'^2 + 2y'$ . Rearranging gives $y'^2 - 2y' + 1 = x'^2$ , or $(y'-1)^2=x'^2$ . There are two cases: $y' \\leq 1$ or $y' > 1$ . If $y' \\leq 1$ , taking the square root of both sides gives $1 - y' = x'$ , and rearranging gives $x' + y' = 1$ . Substituting back in $x'=x^2$ and $y'=y^2$ gives us $x^2+y^2=1$ , the equation for a circle. Similarly, if $y' > 1$ , we take the square root of both sides to get $y' - 1 = x'$ , or $y' - x' = 1$ , which is equivalent to $y^2 - x^2 = 1$ , a hyperbola.

      " We can rewrite the given equation as $2^{a_7-27}=a_7$ . Hence, $a_7$ must be a power of $2$ and larger than $27$ . The first power of 2 that is larger than $27$ , namely $32$ , does satisfy the equation: $2^{32 - 27} = 2^5 = 32$ . In fact, this is the only solution; $2^{a_7-27}$ is exponential whereas $a_7$ is linear, so their graphs will not intersect again. Now, let the common difference in the sequence be $d$ .

Thus, the solution to our problem is $\\sqrt{7} + \\sqrt{7} + \\sqrt{7} + \\sqrt{7} = \\boxed{\\textbf{(D)}\\ 4\\sqrt7}$ . ~mathboy100 Consider triangle $AFG$ . Note that $AF = 2$ , $AG = 1$ , and $\\angle GAF = 120 ^{\\circ}$ because it is an interior angle of a regular hexagon. (See note for details.)

Therefore, the perimeter of $GCHF$ is $4 \\cdot FG = \\boxed{\\textbf{(D)}\\ 4\\sqrt7}$ . Note: The sum of the interior angles of any polygon with $n$ sides is given by $180 ^{\\circ} (n - 2)$ . Therefore, the sum of the interior angles of a hexagon is $720 ^{\\circ}$ , and each interior angle of a regular hexagon measures $\\frac{720 ^{\\circ}}{6} = 120 ^{\\circ}$ . We use a coordinates approach.

It follows that quadrilateral $GCHF$ is a rhombus. Recall the Pythagorean Theorem, which states $a^2+b^2=c^2$ for all right triangles, where $c$ is the hypotenuse of the triangle. However, by drawing a quick diagram of an obtuse triangle, we can see that $a^2+b^2<c^2$ , in any given obtuse triangle. Since $ABCDEF$ is a regular hexagon, all of its angles are obtuse. It follows that $\\triangle{GAF}$ is an obtuse triangle. Using the extended Pythagorean Theorem for obtuse triangles, we have: \\[AG^2+AF^2<GF^2 \\implies 1^2+2^2<GF^2 \\implies \\sqrt{5}<GF\\]  Since $GCHF$ is a rhombus, the perimeter is $4GF$ . This eliminates all answer choices but $D$ and $E$ , since in all of those options $GF<\\sqrt{5}$ . Lastly, $E$ is eliminated due to the triangle inequality, as $1+2$ is not greater than $12/4=3$ .

The best way to solve the system of linear equations is to substitute the $y$ for the $4$ in equation $EH$ . $4=-\\frac{4}{3}x+12 \\frac{1}{3}$ , so $x=6\\frac{1}{4}$ and $y=4$ This would mean $G\\left(6\\frac{1}{4},4\\right)$ . Since we have our $G$ coordinate, we can continue with Solution 3, with the area of the trapezoid $\\left(\\frac{EG+AC}{2}\\right)(CE)$ , where $EG=\\frac{5}{4}$ (using distance formula for $E$ to $G$ ), $AC=5$ , and $CE=5$ . By substitution, we get $\\left(\\frac{\\frac{5}{4}+5}{2}\\right)(5)=$ $\\boxed{\\textbf{(D) }15\\dfrac{5}{8}}$ . ~ghfhgvghj10 (+ minor edits ~TaeKim) Notice the small triangle in the upper right corner is a $3-4-5$ triangle. Then that triangle is similar to the big triangle by AA similarity. From that, do similar triangles and you find that the longer leg of the small triangle is 1. Then you find that the triangle below is $3-4-5$ , so the side length of the rectangle (without the outer rectangle) is 7. afterwards you just add the half of the square + the remaining triangle which can be found by multiplying base and height (in which we already know) ~mathboy282 For reference, use the points labelled in the diagram of Solution 3. The square means $AC = 5$ , so we get a $3$ - $4$ - $5$ triangle $ABC$ . $m\\angle BAC = 90 ^{\\circ} - m\\angle CAG = m\\angle GAH$ . Therefore $\\triangle GAH$ is proportional to a $3$ - $4$ - $5$ triangle, with $HG$ corresponding to $3$ and $AH$ corresponding to $4$ .

      "then $P(x) = (x^2+1)Q_1(x) + xQ_1(x) + x + 2$  Also $P(x) = (x^2+1)Q_2(x) + 2x + 1$  We infer that $Q_1(x)$ and $Q_2(x)$ have same degree, we can assume $Q_1(x) = x + a$ , and $Q_2(x) = x + b$ , since $P(x)$ has least degree. If this cannot work, we will try quadratic, etc. Then we get: $(x^2+1)(Q_1(x) - Q_2(x)) + xQ_1(x) - x + 1 = 0$  The constant term gives us: $(Q_1(x) - Q_2(x)) + 1 = 0$  So $Q_1(x) - Q_2(x) = -1$  Substituting this in gives: $-(x^2+1) + xQ_1(x) - x + 1 = 0$  Solving this equation, we get $Q_1(x) = x + 1$  Plugging this into our original equation we get $P(x) = x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x + 3$  Verify this works with $P(x) = (x^2+1)Q_2(x) + 2x + 1$  Therefore the answer is $1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 3^2 = \\boxed{\\textbf{(E)} \\ 23}$  ~qgcui Notice that we cannot have the quotients equal to some constants, since the same constant will yield different constant terms for $P(x)$ (which is bad) and different constants will yield different first coefficients (also bad). Thus, we try setting the quotients equal to linear terms (for minimizing degree). Let $P(x)=(x^2+x+1)(ax+b)+(x+2)$ and $P(x)=(x^2+1)(ax+c)+(2x+1)$ . The quotients have the same $x$ coefficient, since $P(x)$ must have the same $x^3$ coefficient in both cases. Expanding, we get \\[P(x)=ax^3+(a+b)x^2+(a+b+1)x+(b+2)\\] and \\[P(x)=ax^3+cx^2+(a+2)x+(c+1).\\]  Equating coefficients, we get $b+2=c+1$ , $a+b+1=a+2$ , and $a+b=c$ . From the second equation, we get $b=1$ , then substituting into         the first, $c=2$ . Finally, from $a+b=c$ , we have $a=1$ . Now, $P(x)=(x^2+x+1)(ax+b)+(x+2)=(x^2+x+1)(x+1)+(x+2)=x^3+2x^2+3x+3$ and our answer is \\[1^2+2^2+3^2+3^2=\\boxed{\\textbf{(E)} \\ 23}.\\]  ~MathHayden We construct the following equations in terms of $P(x)$ and the information given by the problem: \\[\\textbf{(1) } P(x)=(x^2+x+1)\\cdot Q(x)+x+2\\]  \\[\\textbf{(2) } P(x)=(x^2+1)\\cdot R(x)+2x+1\\] Upon inspection, $Q(x)$ and $R(x)$ cannot be constant, so the smallest possible degree of $P(x)$ is $3,$ and both $Q(x)$ and $R(x)$ are linear. Let $Q(x)=x-q$ and $R(x)=x-r.$ We know there will be values for $q$ and $r$ that make the below equation hold, so we can assume that $P(x)$ has a leading coefficient of $1$ . Substituting these values in, and setting $\\textbf{(1)}$ and $\\textbf{(2)}$ equal to each  other, \\[(x^2+x+1)(x-q)+x+2=(x^2+1)(x-r)+2x+1.\\] We plug in $x=0$ , yielding $r+1=q.$ Substituting this value into the above equation, \\[(x^2+x+1)(x-r-1)+x+2=(x^2+1)(x-r)+2x+1.\\] Letting $x=1,$ we conclude that $r=-2,$ so $R(x)=x+2.$ Therefore, \\[P(x)=(x^2+1)(x+2)+2x+1 = x^3+2x^3+3x+3.\\] The requested sum is \\[1^2+2^2+3^2+3^2=\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) }23}\\]  -Benedict T (countmath1) By remainder theorem, the polynomial can be written as follows. \\[P(x) = (x^2+x+1)Q_{1}(x)+x+2 = (x^2+1)Q_{2}(x)+2x+1\\] This is a timed exam, we can use the information given by answer choices. The answer choices tell us this is the polynomial with integer coefficients, and we need to find the polynomial with the least degree so we can assume both $Q_{1}(x)$ and $Q_{2}(x)$ are linear (the coefficient of x should be same). Then we can write $P(x)$ as a cubic polynomial. \\[P(x) = (x^2+x+1)(ax+b)+x+2 = (x^2+1)(ax+c)+2x+1\\] Substituting $x=0,1,-1$ to determine the value of $a$ and $b$ . We have: \\[P(0) = b+2 = c+1\\]  \\[P(1) = 3a+3b+3 = 2a+2c+3\\]  \\[P(-1) = -a+b+1 = -2a+2c-1\\]  We can solve the simultaneous equations: $a=1,b=1,c=2$  Hence, $P(x)=(x^2+x+1)(x+1)+x+2=x^3+2x^2+3x+3$ . The answer is $1^2+2^2+3^2+3^2=\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) }23}$  ~PythZhou We are given: $P(x) \\equiv x + 2 \\pmod{x^2+x+1}$  $P(x) \\equiv 2x + 1 \\pmod{x^2+1}$  Since the problem asks us about the coefficients of the polynomial, we should evaluate $P(x)$ at $1$ . Our congruences now become: $P(1) \\equiv 1 + 2 \\pmod{(1)^2+(1)+1}$  $\\implies P(1) \\equiv 3 \\pmod{3} \\implies P(1) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$ . $P(1) \\equiv 2(1) + 1 \\pmod{(1)^2+1}$  $\\implies P(1) \\equiv 3 \\pmod{2} \\implies P(1) \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$ . We now know that the coefficients of the polynomial sum to an odd multiple of 3. We now begin bounding the value of the sum of the coefficients squared. For our answer, the sum of the coefficients squared must be between $10$ and $23$ . Trying a quadratic polynomial, if $P(1) = 3$ , then the maximum of the coefficients squared is $9$ ( $3^2+0^2+0^2$ is the maximum, any other permutation can be trivially shown to be lower). If $P(1) = 9$ , the minimum of the coefficients squared is $27$ ( $3^2+3^2+3^2$ , once again, any other permutation can be trivially shown to be higher). Any higher value of $P(1)$ obviously will not work, so $P(x)$ cannot be a quadratic. Since a quadratic did not work, we now move up to a cubic. We start with $P(1) = 3$ . Similarly to the quadratic, there is no way to get an answer within the range of the answer choices. However, moving up to $P(1) = 9$ , we get that the minimum of the coefficients squared is $81/4$ (which we get from all 4 coefficients being equal at $9/4$ ). Since this is the minimum, any other answers will be higher. We get that $\\boxed{\\textbf{(E) }23}$ is our answer, since it is the only answer choice greater than $81/4$ . -SwordOfJustice https://youtu.be/yGUur4vP_6k  ~ ThePuzzlr https://youtu.be/ELdhkqVyB9E  ~Steven Chen (Professor Chen Education Palace, www.professorchenedu.com) https://youtu.be/HdrbPiZHim0  ~ pi_is_3.14 https://youtu.be/7FiTsDNMmgg  https://youtu.be/TvOHfDJ_2Ag  ~Interstigation https://youtu.be/UEQOPjlqh94  ~IceMatrix\n",

Starting with $2019$ , \\begin{align*} 7S_{2019} &\\equiv 1 \\pmod{2^{2019}} \\\\ 7S_{2019} &= 2^{2019}k + 1. \\end{align*} Now, take both sides $\\operatorname{mod} \\ 7$ : \\[0 \\equiv 2^{2019}k + 1 \\pmod{7}.\\] Using Fermat's Little Theorem, \\[2^{2019} = (2^{336})^6 \\cdot 2^3 \\equiv 2^3 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}.\\] Thus, \\[0 \\equiv k + 1 \\pmod{7} \\implies k \\equiv 6 \\pmod{7} \\implies k = 7j + 6.\\] Therefore, \\[7S_{2019} = 2^{2019} (7j + 6) + 1 \\implies S_{2019} = \\frac{2^{2019} (7j + 6) + 1}{7}.\\]  We may repeat this same calculation with $S_{2023}$ to yield \\[S_{2023} = \\frac{2^{2023} (7h + 3) + 1}{7}.\\] Now, we notice that $S_n$ is basically an integer expressed in binary form with $n$ bits.\n",
      "This gives rise to a simple inequality, \\[0 \\leqslant S_n \\leqslant 2^n.\\] Since the maximum possible number that can be generated with $n$ bits is \\[\\underbrace{{11111\\dotsc1}_2}_{n} = \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 2^k = 2^n - 1 \\leqslant 2^n.\\] Looking at our calculations for $S_{2019}$ and $S_{2023}$ , we see that the only valid integers that satisfy that constraint are $j = h = 0$ . \\[\\frac{S_{2023} - S_{2019}}{2^{2019}} = \\frac{\\tfrac{2^{2023} \\cdot 3 + 1}{7} - \\tfrac{2^{2019} \\cdot 6 + 1}{7}}{2^{2019}} = \\frac{2^4 \\cdot 3 - 6}{7} = \\boxed{\\textbf{(A) } 6}.\\] ~zoomanTV As in Solution 2, we note that \\[x_{2019}+2x_{2020}+4x_{2021}+8x_{2022}=\\frac{S_{2023}-S_{2019}}{2^{2019}}.\\] We also know that $7S_{2023} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2^{2023}}$ and $7S_{2019} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2^{2019}}$ , this implies: \\[\\textbf{(1) } 7S_{2023}=2^{2023}\\cdot{x} + 1,\\]  \\[\\textbf{(2) } 7S_{2019}=2^{2019}\\cdot{y} + 1.\\] Dividing by $7$ , we can isolate the previous sums: \\[\\textbf{(3) } S_{2023}=\\frac{2^{2023}\\cdot{x} + 1}{7},\\]  \\[\\textbf{(4) } S_{2019}=\\frac{2^{2019}\\cdot{y} + 1}{7}.\\] The maximum value of $S_n$ occurs when every $x_i$ is equal to $1$ . Even when this happens, the value of $S_n$ is less than $2^n$ . Therefore, we can construct the following inequalities: \\[\\textbf{(3) } S_{2023}=\\frac{2^{2023}\\cdot{x} + 1}{7} < 2^{2023},\\]  \\[\\textbf{(4) } S_{2019}=\\frac{2^{2019}\\cdot{y} + 1}{7} < 2^{2019}.\\] From these two equations, we can deduce that both $x$ and $y$ are less than $7$ . Reducing $\\textbf{1}$ and $\\textbf{2}$  $\\pmod{7},$ we see that \\[2^{2023}\\cdot{x}\\equiv 6\\pmod{7},\\] and \\[2^{2019}\\cdot{y}\\equiv 6\\pmod{7}.\\]  The powers of $2$ repeat every $3, \\pmod{7}.$  Therefore, $2^{2023}\\equiv 2 \\pmod 7$ and $2^{2019} \\equiv 1 \\pmod {7}.$ Substituing this back into the above equations, \\[2x\\equiv{6}\\pmod{7}\\] and \\[y\\equiv{6}\\pmod{7}.\\]  Since $x$ and $y$ are integers less than $7$ , the only values of $x$ and $y$ are $3$ and $6$ respectively. The requested sum is \\begin{align*} \\frac{S_{2023}-S_{2019}}{2^{2019}} &= \\frac{\\frac{2^{2023}\\cdot{x} + 1}{7} - \\frac{2^{2019}\\cdot{y} + 1}{7}}{2^{2019}} \\\\ &= \\frac{1}{2^{2019}}\\left(\\frac{2^{2023}\\cdot{3} + 1}{7} -\\left(\\frac{2^{2019}\\cdot{6} + 1}{7}  \\right)\\right) \\\\ &= \\frac{3\\cdot{2^4}-6}{7} \\\\ &= \\boxed{\\textbf{(A) } 6}. \\end{align*} -Benedict T (countmath1) Note that, as in Solution 2, we have \\[x_{2019} + 2x_{2020} + 4x_{2021} + 8x_{2022} = \\frac{S_{2023} - S_{2019}}{2^{2019}}.\\] This is because \\[S_{2023} = x_{0}2^{0} + x_{1}2^{1} + \\cdots + x_{2019}2^{2019} + \\cdots + x_{2022}2^{2022}\\] and \\[S_{2019} = x_{0}2^{0} + x_{1}2^{1} + \\cdots + x_{2018}2^{2018}.\\] Note that \\[S_{2023} - S_{2019} = x_{2019}2^{2019} + \\cdots + x_{2022}2^{2022} = 2^{2019}(x_{2019} + 2x_{2020} + 4x_{2021} + 8x_{2022}).\\] Therefore, \\[x_{2019} + 2x_{2020} + 4x_{2021} + 8x_{2022} = \\frac{S_{2023} - S_{2019}}{2^{2019}}.\\] Multiplying both sides by 7 gives us \\[7(x_{2019} + 2x_{2020} + 4x_{2021} + 8x_{2022}) = \\frac{7S_{2023} - 7S_{2019}}{2^{2019}}.\\] We can write \\[7S_{2023} = 1\\pmod{2^{2023}} = 1 + 2^{2023}a = 1 + 2^{2019}*16a\\] and \\[7S_{2019} = 1\\pmod{2^{2019}} = 1 + 2^{2019}b\\] for some a and b. Substituting, we get \\[7(x_{2019} + 2x_{2020} + 4x_{2021} + 8x_{2022}) = \\frac{(1 + 2^{2019} * 16a) - (1 + 2^{2019}b)}{2^{2019}} = 16a - b.\\] Therefore, our answer can be written as \\[\\frac{16a - b}{7}.\\] Another thing to notice is that a and b are integers between 0 and 6. This is because \\[7(1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + \\cdots + 2^{2022}) \\geqslant 7S_{2023} = 1 + 2^{2023}a\\] which is \\[7(2^{2023}) - 7 \\geqslant 1 + 2^{2023}a\\]  \\[(7-a) \\geqslant \\frac{8}{2^{2023}}\\] which only holds when a is less than 7 because the right is very small positive number, so the left must be positive, too. Clearly, a is also non-negative, because otherwise, \\[7S_{2023} = 1 + 2^{2023}a < 0\\] which would mean \\[S_{2023} < 0\\] which cannot happen, so a is greater than 0.  A similar explanation for b shows that b is an integer between 0 and 6 inclusive. Going back to the solution, if our answer to the problem is n, then \\[16a - b = 7n\\] and \\[16a = 7n + b,\\] so we can try the five option choices and see which one, when multiplied by 7 and added to some whole number between 0 and 6 results in a multiple of 16. Trying all the option choices, we see that you need to add 7n to something more than 6 to equal a multiple of 16 other than for option A. Therefore, the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A) } 6}.$  -Rutvik Arora (youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkgAgmNAQV8WGTOazGYEGwg )\n",

Clearly, the entire figure has 8-fold symmetry. Therefore, we can calculate the area of $ODBA$ and multiply it by 8. We split $[ODBA]$ into $[ODBC]+[ABC]$ . Knowing the side length of the hexagon is $1$ , we can use 30-60-90 triangles within the hexagon to find the total distance between opposite edges is $2\\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}=\\sqrt{3}.$ Thus, $OD=\\sqrt{3}-\\frac{1}{2}$ and $BC=\\sqrt{3}-1.$ Recognizing $DB=\\frac{1}{2}$ and $ODBC$ is a trapezoid, \\[8\\cdot[ODBC]=2\\left(\\sqrt{3}-\\frac{1}{2}+\\sqrt{3}-1\\right)=4\\sqrt{3}-3.\\]  Next, we aim to find $[ABC]$ . By angle chasing, we find $\\angle A=105^\\circ,$  $\\angle B=30^\\circ,$ and $\\angle C = 45^\\circ.$ We can use the law of sines to find $AB$ : \\[\\frac{\\sin(105^\\circ)}{\\sqrt{3}-1}=\\frac{\\sin(45^\\circ)}{AB}\\implies AB=\\frac{\\sqrt{6}-\\sqrt{2}}{2\\sin(105^\\circ)}.\\]  We may not know what $\\sin(105^\\circ)$ is by memory, but we can cleverly calculate it using a common trig identity: \\begin{align*}     \\sin(105^\\circ)&=\\sin(60^\\circ+45^\\circ),\\\\     &=\\sin(60^\\circ)\\cos(45^\\circ)+\\cos(60^\\circ)\\sin(45^\\circ),\\\\     &=\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\cdot\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}+\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2},\\\\     &=\\frac{\\sqrt{6}+\\sqrt{2}}{4}. \\end{align*}  With some simplification, we'll find $AB=4-2\\sqrt{3}$ .

We note that 2 adjacent hexagons are rotated $90^\\circ$ with respect to the other, so the angles between any sides is $150^\\circ$ . In particular, as the purple triangles are isosceles, they have angles $150^\\circ,15^\\circ$ , and $15^\\circ$ , and the octagon is equiangular (all its angles are $135^\\circ$ ). Thus, we can draw a square around the octagon, and we note that the ``cut out\" triangles are all isosceles right triangles. Now, we calculate the side length of the square. Note that the hexagon has a height of $\\sqrt 3$ , so the length of a side of the square is $2\\sqrt 3-1$ . In particular, the horizontal/vertical sides of the octagon have length $1$ , so the legs of the isosceles triangles are \\[\\frac{2\\sqrt3-1-1}2=\\sqrt3-1\\] Thus, the area of the octagon is \\[(2\\sqrt3-1)^2-4\\cdot\\frac 12(\\sqrt3-1)^2=5\\] Now, we calculate the area of one of the four isosceles triangles. The base of the triangle is $(\\sqrt 3-1)\\sqrt 2$ , so the area is \\[\\frac 14\\mathrm{base length}^2\\cdot\\tan(\\mathrm{base angle})=\\frac 14((\\sqrt3-1)\\sqrt2)^2\\cdot\\tan15^\\circ=\\frac 14(8-4\\sqrt3)(2-\\sqrt3)=7-4\\sqrt 3\\] Thus, the area of the dodecagon is \\[5-4(7-4\\sqrt3)=16\\sqrt3-23\\] Thus the answer is $16+3-23=-4$ , or $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B)}}$ . ~cr. naman12 2022AMC12B.jpeg  Note that each of the green sections is a rectangle, so its interior angles are all $90^{\\circ}.$ Since $\\angle{ABC}=120^{\\circ}$ , every one of the orange sections is a $30-60-90$ right triangle. Define $x$ to be the distance from the corner of the square with side length $1$ to the corner of the larger blue square. Due to the sides of the two squares being parallel to each other, the large blue triangle is a $45-45-90$ right triangle. By $AAA$ similarity, the smaller blue triangles are also $45-45-90,$ and have side lengths of $\\frac{x\\sqrt{2}}{2}, \\frac{x\\sqrt{2}}{2},$ and $x$ . By $30-60-90$ triangle relations, the largest altitude of the orange triangle is $\\frac{x\\sqrt{6}}{2}.$  Now, we can find the height of the hexagon to obtain an equation in terms of $x$ . Consider a hexagon with side length $1$ , where point $P$ is the foot of the perpendicular dropped from $B$ , bisecting $\\angle{ABC}$ : [asy]         import geometry;         import fontsize;         defaultpen(fontsize(9pt));         unitsize(3cm);         draw(shift((1/2,1-sqrt(3)/2))*polygon(6));         draw((1,1-sqrt(3))--(1, 1)--cycle,linewidth(1));         draw((3/2,1-sqrt(3)/2)--(1, 1-sqrt(3)/2)--cycle,linewidth(1));         draw((1, 1-sqrt(3)/2)--(1.1, 1-sqrt(3)/2)--(1.1, 1-sqrt(3)/2 +0.1)--(1, 1-sqrt(3)/2+0.1)--cycle,linewidth(1));         draw((1, 1-sqrt(3)/2)--(1.1, 1-sqrt(3)/2)--(1.1, 1-sqrt(3)/2 -0.1)--(1, 1-sqrt(3)/2-0.1)--cycle,linewidth(1));         label(\"$A$\", (1, 1), N);         label(\"$P$\", (1, 1-sqrt(3)/2), W);         label(\"$C$\", (1, 1-sqrt(3)), S);         label(\"$B$\", (3/2, 1-sqrt(3)/2), E);         label(\"$60^{\\circ}$\", (3/2-0.025, 1-sqrt(3)/2), NW);         label(\"$60^{\\circ}$\", (3/2-0.025, 1-sqrt(3)/2), SW); [/asy] Note that triangles $\\triangle{APB}$ and $\\triangle{CPB}$ are congruent $30-60-90$ triangles, by SAS congruence. Since the side length of this hexagon is $1$ , the length of $AP$ is $\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot \\sqrt{3} =\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$ , by $30-60-90$ triangle relations. The height of the hexagon is twice this value, or $\\sqrt{3}.$  The height is also equal to the sum of the values along the long blue line, in the first diagram. Therefore, $1+\\frac{x\\sqrt{2}}{2}+\\frac{x\\sqrt{6}}{2}=\\sqrt{3}.$ Solving and rationalizing, $x=2\\sqrt{2}-\\sqrt{6}.$  The area of the dodecagon is equal to the sum of the areas of the four rectangles, eight orange triangles, and purple square. In terms of $x$ , this is \\[8\\cdot \\frac{1}{2}\\cdot \\frac{x\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\cdot \\frac{x\\sqrt{6}}{{2}}+4\\cdot 1\\cdot\\frac{x\\sqrt{6}}{2}+(x\\sqrt{2}+1)^2.\\]  Plugging in $x=2\\sqrt{2}-\\sqrt{6}$ , the area of the dodecagon is $16\\sqrt{3}-23$ . Therefore, the answer is $16+3-23=$  $\\boxed{\\textbf{(B) }-4}.$  -Benedict T (countmath1)  Obviously, each of the hexagon have area of $\\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2}$ , which gives a total of $6\\sqrt{3}$ . Now we calculate the area of the intersection of two hexagons. There are two cases :  Case 1 : The hexagons are on the opposite sides In this case, we see that the two hexagons' intersection is the middle square plus two triangles on its side. The square have area $1$ . Each of the triangles are $120-30-30$ , and hence its short side is $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}$ because its longer side is $1$ . Therefore, each of the small triangles have area of $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{12}$ , so each of the intersections have $1+\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{6}$ area. Since there are $2$ pairs of hexagons on opposite side of each other, that gives a total area of $2+\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}$ .  Case 2 : The hexagons are adjacent [asy] pair[] A,B; path h1, h2,h3,h4; h1 = shift((sqrt(3)-1)/2*dir(90))*polygon(6); h2 = shift((sqrt(3)-1)/2*dir(0))*rotate(90)*polygon(6); h3 = shift((sqrt(3)-1)/2*dir(-90))*polygon(6); h4 = shift((sqrt(3)-1)/2*dir(180))*rotate(90)*polygon(6); B.cyclic=true; B.push((0,0)); int indexSquare[] = sequence(4); int indexPolygon[] = sequence(12); for(int i : indexSquare){ A.push(1/sqrt(2)*dir(45+90*i)); } draw(A[0]--A[1]--A[2]--A[3]--cycle); fill(h1,green); fill(h2,red); fill(buildcycle(h2,h1),yellow); draw(h1); draw(h2); draw(h3); draw(h4); for(int i : sequence(4)) { for(int j : sequence(3)) { B.push(B[3*i+j]+((sqrt(3)-1.5)*(j-1)*(j)+4-2*sqrt(3))*dir(90*i+60+30*j*(1.5*(j-1)-1))); } } for(int i=0; i <12; ++i) { draw(shift(0.5,0.5-sqrt(3))*(B[i])--shift(0.5,0.5-sqrt(3))*(B[i + 1]),linewidth(2)); } [/asy]  In this case, their intersection is a convex hexagon. We cut it in half and we're left with a quadrilateral with two sides with length one (because it shares these sides with one of the hexagons, and for this reason the angle between the two sides is $120$ degrees) and one short side and one long side. Here, we divide the area even further. We draw a line that divide the quadrilateral into a triangle with side lengths $1$ , $1$ , and $\\sqrt{3}$ (because it is $30-30-120$ ) and another triangle with unknown side lengths. Simple angle chasing yields the triangle with unknown side lengths is a $15-75-90$ triangle. If you remembered your sines and cosines, you know that $\\sin{15}=\\frac{\\sqrt{6}-\\sqrt{2}}{4}$ or you can calculate it by using the fact that $\\sin{15}=\\sin{45-30}$ . Also, $\\sin{75}=\\frac{\\sqrt{6}+\\sqrt{2}}{4}$ . Now, because the $15-75-90$ triangle have one side with length $\\sqrt{3}$ (it shares the side with the other triangle) and it corresponds to the 75 degrees angle, we have \\[\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{\\frac{\\sqrt{6}+\\sqrt{2}}{4}}=\\frac{x}{\\frac{\\sqrt{6}-\\sqrt{2}}{4}}\\]  \\[\\implies x=\\frac{\\sqrt{3}{(\\sqrt{6}-\\sqrt{2})}}{\\sqrt{6}+\\sqrt{2}}=2\\sqrt{3}-3\\]  where $x$ denote the shorter leg of the $15-75-90$ triangle. Hence, that triangle have area \\[\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} x=\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}(2\\sqrt{3}-3)=\\frac{6-3\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\] . The isosceles $120-30-30$ triangle obviously have area $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}$ , and that gives a total of $\\frac{12-5\\sqrt{3}}{4}$ . We multiply that by $2$ because $\\frac{12-5\\sqrt{3}}{4}$ is only half of the intersection of the hexagons. We multiply the result by $4$ because there are $4$ pairs of adjacent hexagons. That gives $24-10\\sqrt{3}$ , which is it for Case 2. Now that we got the total area of the intersection of two hexagons, we find the area of the intersection of three hexagons. Note that the intersection of any three hexagons is just the middle square plus one small triangle on the side. Again, the middle square have area $1$ and the triangle have area $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{12}$ , so the total is $1+\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{12}$ . We multiply that by $4\\choose3$ to get $4+\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}$ . Then, we calculate the area of the intersection of all four hexagons, which is just the middle square with area $1$ . Finally, we apply PIE. The total area is \\[6\\sqrt{3}-[(2+\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3})+(24-10\\sqrt{3})]+(4+\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3})-1=16\\sqrt{3}-23\\] , so our final answer is $16+3-23=\\boxed{(B)-4}$ . $\\blacksquare$ ~ Ddk001  https://youtu.be/QYclqXWnxxE  ~Steven Chen (Professor Chen Education Palace, www.professorchenedu.com) https://youtu.be/jLKP3VFaTkk  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRrRLIwSPGY \n",
